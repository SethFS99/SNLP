Are they laughing at or with me?
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes
I think that I'm so happy now
And I think this is a better you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Are they laughing at or with me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Why can't we just say what we mean?

People are just trying to fit in
But is this something telling you?
You can't trust anyone in this town
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes


Don't put your money where your mouth is, baby
We don't want to see you choke
Nobody's choking around here anymore
Nobody's broken any high scores

No dancing shoes have touched this dusty floors
For such a long, long time
For such a long, long time
For such a long time


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

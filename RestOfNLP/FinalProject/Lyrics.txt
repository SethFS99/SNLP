
 
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, “If you dare, come a little closer”

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh
 
<<Sentimental>>
 
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I... am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye

Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would've followed you, oh-oh
Say something, I'm giving up on you

Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something...

You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life

I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right

You were just a small bump unborn
Just four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why

Teardrops

We hurt ourselves for fun
Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb
Addicted to a lonely kind of love
What I wanna know

Is how we got this stressed out, paranoid
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

I'm tripping on the edge
High as a kite, I'm never coming down
And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels
To be alone

So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid?
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ
Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing

You bought a star in the sky tonight
Because your life is dark and it needs some light
You named it after me, but I’m not yours to keep
Because you’ll never see, that the stars are free

Oh we don’t own our heavens now
We only own our hell
And if you don’t know that by now
Then you don’t know me that well

All my life I’ve been so lonely
All in the name of being holy
Still, you’d like to think you know me
You keep buyin’ stars
And you could buy up all of the stars
But it wouldn’t change who you are
You’re still living life in the dark
It’s just who you are
It’s just who you are

You bought a star in the sky tonight
And in your man-made dark
The light inside you died

Oh we don’t own our heavens now
We only own our hell
And if you don’t know that by now
Then you don’t know me that well

All my life I've been so lonely
All in the name of being holy
And still, you'd like to think you own me
You keep buying stars
And you could buy up all the stars
But it wouldn't change who you are
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are
It's just who you are

You know only how to own me
You know only how to own me
You’re buying stars to shut out the light
We come alone and alone we die
And no matter how hard you try
I’ll always belong in the sky

And you could buy up all of the stars
But it wouldn’t change who you are
You’re still living life in the dark
It’s just who you are
It’s just who you are
It’s who you are
It’s who you are
It’s who you are
It’s who you are
It’s who you are
It’s who you are
It’s who you are

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty

Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?

My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

And if you call, I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

I'm really on the ropes this time
I've been fighting all my life for you
I never should've said goodbye
But maybe that's what stupid people do

'Cause you gave me peace
And I wasted it
I'm here to admit
That you were my medicine
Oh, I couldn't quit
And I'm down on my knees again
Asking for nothing

Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't think I could forgive myself
I'm sorry for the ways that I used you
And I could care less right now
But you know, you hurt me pretty good too

Yeah, we made each other bleed
And we tasted it
I'm here to admit
That you were my medicine
Oh, love, I couldn't quit
And I'm down on my knees again

Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Oh, thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh

So wake me up when they build that time machine
I want to go back
Wake me up when you were sleeping next to me
'Cause I really loved you, ooh

Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life ooh
Thank you for the happiest year of my life, yeah
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life

Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou
Oh

When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love

I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oooo I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

I won't I won't I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine, until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

Well, it's good to hear your voice
I hope you're doing fine
And if you ever wonder, I'm lonely here tonight
I'm lost here in this moment and time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish, I'd have you by my side

Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you

And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay

Well, I try to live without you
And tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside
I look up at the stars, hoping you're doing the same
And somehow I feel closer
And I can hear you say

Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you

And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will

Stay, always stay
I never wanna lose you
And if I had to, I would choose you
So stay
Please always stay
You're the one that I hold onto
'Cause my heart would stop without you

I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay
I'll always stay
And I love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask I will stay
I will stay

Don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium
Don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium
I wanna stay in love with my sorrow

Oh
But God, I wanna let it go
Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone
Couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show
Never wanted it to be so cold
Just didn't drink enough to say you love me

I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me

Lithium
Don't wanna lock me up inside

Don't wanna forget how it feels without

Don't wanna let it lay me down this time
Drown my will to fly
Here in the darkness I know myself
Can't break free until I let it go
Let me go
Darling, I forgive you after all
Anything is better than to be alone
And in the end I guess I had to fall
Always find my place among the ashes

I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me

You're tired now, lie down
I'll be waitin' to give you the good news
It might take patience
And when you wake up, it won't be over
So don't you give up

We've got the time to take the world
And make it better than it ever was
That's what they'll say about us

If I say a cliché, it's 'cause I mean it
We can't walk away, we gotta get in between it
And when you wake up, we'll grow together
So don't you give up

We've got the time to take the world
And make it better than it ever was
That's what they'll say about us

I never said it would be easy
I'm never giving up, believe me
I used to think the pain would fade, but it never does

You're tired now, lie down
I'll be waitin' to give you the good news
It might take patience

And there she goes
She's sitting real nice with her head full of advice from friends
She walks around
She tries to rearrange but everything goes under her bed

And it's countless
She's got a jar full of change saved up for vacation
And she's watching
She's watching her sons growing up just like their mom
And it's hard, for her

And I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Gotta start lifting your head up, head up, head up
And I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I know it's hard but you gotta get outta bed, outta bed, outta bed

Yeah she don't know what to do
She's got everything and nothing to lose
She got a call from a guy just seeing if she's alright
(better not panic, better not panic, better not panic)

She's got a face full of tears held back by the strength of five
And she says, "Happiness ain't free
Everybody fights just like me
But I've given up the ability to retreat"

And I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
You gotta start lifting your head up, head up, head up
And I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I know it's hard but you gotta get outta bed, outta bed, outta bed

Yeah she don't know what to do
She's got everything and nothing to lose

I'm sleepwalking with a hand full of blue dice
One Hail Mary for the hole in my heart
I'm outside waiting for your love on the boulevard

You're a heavenly creature
With a real dark agenda
You can turn a believer
To a damn dirty sinner
Am I having a seizure?
'Cause I'm shaking up with fear
But I know, yeah, I know that...

You're no casanova
Got to let you go
Hit me on my blind side
Left me on the floor

It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose

Take your eyes off of me so I can leave

This is never ending, we have been here before

Please stay where you are, don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight

Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me
 
<<Negative>>
 
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
I'm going back to the start

Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

One month till February
Keep on holdin' on
And I know it's short
And I know it's short
One month till February
Keep on holdin' on
And I know it's short
And I know it's short

And it's times like these

And it's times like these
And it's days like

It's been a long time comin'
But I'm falling short
It's been a long time comin'
But I'm falling short

Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this
Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this
Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this
Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this

It's been a long time comin'
But I'm falling short
(Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this
Not too far to carry this
Not too far to carry )

Because you took something away from yourself
Come back to this route and take your heart to higher self
Heart to higher shelf
(Not too far to carry this)
Because you took something away from yourself
Come back to this route and take your heart to higher self
One month till February
And this is how I feel
Because you took something away from yourself
Come back to this route and take your heart to higher self
One month till February

If I don't say this now, I will surely break
As I'm leaving the one I wanna take
Forgive the urgency, but hurry up and wait
My heart has started to separate

Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you

There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you, won't you be the one I'll always know?
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down

Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you
And I'll look after you

If ever there was a doubt
My love, she leans into me
This most assuredly counts
She says most assuredly

Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you
After you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh

It's always have and never hold
You've begun to feel like home
What's mine is yours to leave or take
What's mine is yours to make your own

Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And  it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

Got the news today
Doctor said I had to stay a little bit longer and I'll be fine
When I thought it'd all been done
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know

All this time goes by, still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
Waiting on a cure, but none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know

You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know, no, no
Yeah

But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, yeah, oh
You don't even know, no, no

So I'll wait 'til kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
I'll be fine

If I could choose anything
I would be good in bed one day
I would fall into love and stay
I'd fall into love

And it’s not fair
I keep on writing a sequel to stories
I know that are not there
I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live like this

I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again

If I am telling the truth
Watching my friends break their hearts into two
Makes me jealous, I know that it’s cruel
But what can you do?

And it's not fair
I keep on writing a sequel to stories
I know that are not there
I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live like this

I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again

Can you tell me a secret?
Can you tell me what's wrong with me?
I know I should be angry
But I can barely feel a fucking thing
Can you tell me a secret?
Can you tell me what's wrong with me?
Can you tell me what's wrong with me?

I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really

Can you tell me a secret?
Can you tell me what's wrong with me?
I know I should be angry
But I can barely feel a fucking thing
Can you tell me a secret?
Can you tell me what’s wrong with me?
Can you tell me what’s wrong with me?

If I would know you, would you know me?
If I would know you, would you know me?
If I would know you, would you know me?
If I would know you, would you know me?

Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change
Tell me that you'll feel the same
And we'll stay here forever
Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change
Tell me that it'll stay the same
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going, where we're going

Tell me that it'll stay the same
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going

But the truth is funnier than that. It is that you are looking right at the brilliant light now that the experience you are having that you call ordinary everyday consciousness – pretending you're not 'it' – that experience is exactly the same thing as 'it'. There's no difference at all. And when you find that out, you laugh yourself silly. That's the great discovery

If I would know you, would you know me?
If I would know you, would you know me?
If I would know you, would you know me?
If I would know you, would you know me?

Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change
Tell me that we'll stay the same
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we go

We started out as friends in the Lower East
Did a couple drugs at the house parties
Late nights in taxi cabs
Wish I could have 'em back
'Cause there's a lot of things that I never said
Now you're with somebody else in a different bed
You're happy, I could see
And that's so hard for me

When you walk in the bar with someone, holding hands
Introduce me to her, say I'm just an old friend
And you ask how I've been
I say I'm doing fine, but I'm lying

I take another shot, need the novocaine
Wish it would numb my heart way it numbs my brain
But it's all love
I don't feel it, but it's all love
The way you kiss on her neck with that look in your eyes
Do it right in front of me, kinda makes me wanna die
But it's all love
I hate the feeling, but it's all love

Should we forget about the past? Is that how you cope?
Should we drink a little more of that rum and Coke?
I don't know how to be
When she looks a bit like me

When you walk in the bar with someone, holding hands
Introduce me to her, say I'm just an old friend
And you ask how I've been
I say I'm doing fine, but I'm fuckin' lying

I take another shot, need the novocaine
Wish it would numb my heart way it numbs my brain
But it's all love
I don't feel it, but it's all love
The way you kiss on her neck with that look in your eyes
Do it right in front of me, kinda makes me wanna die
But it's all love
Hate the feeling, but it's all love

It's all love
All love

So I take another shot, novocaine
Wish it would numb my heart, numb my brain
But it's all love
The way you kiss on her neck with that look in your eyes
Do it right in front of me, kinda makes me wanna die
But it's all love
I hate the feeling, but it's all love
Oh no, no, no, no, no
It's all love, baby
You know it's all love (It's all love)
(It's all love)
(It's all love)
It's all love
It's all love

I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzzcut Season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you, but I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home (Tired of love, tired of love)
Wanna go home, woah (Tired of love)

One, two

Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek

They say, "You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

They say, "You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun

Daydream
Life feels like a daydream
And I just wish that I could wake up
I just wish that I could wake up
My mind
Whispers in the nighttime
Voices always keeping me up
Telling me that I should give up

'Cause lately, I've been in the backseat to my own life
Trying to take control, but I don't know how to

I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to be sad no more
I don't want to wake up and wonder
What the hell am I doing this for
I don't want to be medicated
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to go one more day
I just want to wake up and realize
Everything's going to be okay
I don't know how else to say it
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore

I'm coming through to the other side
I'll make it through to tomorrow
'Cause that's all I can do today, do today

'Cause lately, I've been in the backseat to my own life
Trying to take control, but I don't know how to

I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to be sad no more

I don't want to be sad anymore

Sad anymore
Sad anymore

Yeah, I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you runnin' from
And what matters ain't the "Who's baddest", but the
Ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder, when you're

Feelin' like you feelin' now
And doin' things just to please your crowd
When I love you like the way I love you
And I suffer, but I ain't gonna cut you, 'cause

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

Every time I close my eyes
I think, I think 'bout you inside
And your mother, givin' up on askin' why
Why you lie, and you cheat, and you try to make a fool outta she...

Now, I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you're runnin' from
And what matters ain't the "Who's baddest", but the

When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

Oh, tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around
Everything is alright now

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

Mmm
It'll all be alright

So you're deep like the ocean
And got your bottles of potion
I believe in karma
Set the waves into motion

Cold, cold, cold, cold hands over me
Fuck, fuck, fuck some sense into me
Gold for loneliness, I will pay
Fuck, fuck some sense into me

The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
The struggle is real

So you got all the answers
Hold the reigns on your dancer
Pull me underwater
Tell 'em nobody gets hurt

Cold, cold, cold, cold hands over me
Fuck, fuck, fuck some sense into me
Gold for loneliness, I will pay
Fuck, fuck some sense into me

The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
The struggle is real

I've got my way with words
Don’t believe me
Pretend like I don't hurt
I don’t, I don’t, I don’t
I've got my way with pain
Don’t believe me
I numb myself to blame
I don’t, I don’t, I don’t
Don't, oh-oh
Don't believe me, yeah, oh

Cold, cold, cold, cold hands over me
Fuck, fuck some sense into me

The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
The struggle is real

Tell me, baby, tell me slowly
All the things you couldn't show me
Tell me one more time before I leave
Now I see you never knew me
Look at you, you look right through me
Tell me one more time before I go

I don't believe you when you
Say you love me most
And when you tell me I'm the only one
And I can't feel you when you're
Touchin' me and tellin' me
That this time you want all of me
And you won't hear me when I'm
Tellin' you it's all or nothin'
All or nothin', baby please
Let go of me, let go of me

When you say you love me, baby
Let me see your face
And when you say you'll never leave me
Know it's all in vain
And these memories, they will haunt me
Wherever I go

Tell me, baby, say it slowly
All the things you never showed me
Tell me one more time before I leave
Now I see you hardly know me
I learned your way, I learned so slowly
Take another shot, but you'll miss me

I don't believe you when you
Tell me that you love me most
And tell me I'm the only one
And I can't feel you when you're
Kissin' me and tellin' me
That all my fears are in my head
And you don't hear me when I
Tell you that it's all or nothin'
All or nothin', baby please
Let go of me

When you say you love me, baby
Let me see your face
And when you say you'll never leave me
Know that it's all in vain
And these memories, they will haunt me
Wherever I go

Hate your friends
I hate your mom and dad
I hope they hate me back
I guess for once, I'm being honest
Gotta be a lot that's wrong with you
To want to be with me
It's kind of sweet when we

We fight until someone's calling the cops
But you never blame it on me
You're so annoying
Four in the morning, you're changing the locks
How could you do this to me-e-e? (Oh)

I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only need, need you when you don't need me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?

Apologize, never apologize
You hate the way I lie
So here you go, I'm being honest
Narcissist, come on, give us a kiss
Let's have some fun with it
It's kinda sweet (It's kinda sweet)

Four in the morning, you're changing the locks
How could you do this to me-e-e? (Oh)

I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me

I, I, I only need, need you when you don't need me

So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?

If I'm fucking crazy, you're fucking crazy, we're all fucking crazy
Why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?

Thoughts
Sometimes, I just can't control my thoughts
No medication's ever made them stop
All I think about is everything I'm not
Instead of everything I got

'Cause I'm scared they're all laughing, so I make the joke first
If I beat 'em to the punchline, then I can't get hurt
Yeah, I swear to God I'm trying, but I don't know how to be
How to be a good friend to me

'Cause sometimes, I just feel like I'm a freak
When I wake up, I just don't like what I see
All the way from my head right down to my feet
I wish that I thought differently

But I'm scared they're all laughing, so I make the joke first
If I beat 'em to the punchline, then I can't get hurt
Yeah, I swear to God I'm trying, but I don't know how to be
How to be a good friend to me

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Change
Wonder if I'll ever really change, mmm

'Cause I'm scared they're all laughing, so I make the joke first
If I beat 'em to the punchline, then I can't get hurt
Yeah, I swear to God I'm trying, but I don't know how to be
How to be a good friend
To the voice inside my head that's telling me I'm okay
Entertain it for a second, then I push it away
Yeah, I swear to God I'm trying, but I don't know how to be
How to be a good friend to me

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you

Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here shoulda gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone

I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't wanna face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around

So I'm touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do? (Haha)
Oh, I'm hungry and wasted and my hands are shaking
I shouldn't be cooking, but spilling hot water
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

Been through every emotion
Right now, I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up
Wish I could get a little un-drunk
So I could, I could un-love you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you

I had my first good dream
Now that you're haunting me
Here in between the sheets
Right where our two worlds meet
This must be the hour
Right before the daybreak
Leave behind the coldest blue ache
I had my first good dream
Now that you're here with me

When I call your name
I don't feel the burn
Standing in the flame
Flame, flame, flame

We end up on the floor
You set my head free
I want you more and more
Don't wanna get clean
You're like morphine
You're like morphine
You're like morphine
You are my morphine

We never leave the room
I guess there's no need to
Nothing but me and you
Visions in bird's eye view
This must be the morning
Never saw it coming
I was tangled up in your limbs
We never leave the room
Now that I'm here with you

Again I call your name
I don't feel the burn
Standing in your flame
Flame, flame

We end up on the floor
You set my head free
I want you more and more
Don't wanna get clean
You're like morphine
You're like morphine

Did I say something wrong?
Did you hear what I was thinking?
Did I talk way too long
When I told you all my feelings that night?
Is it you? Is it me?
Did you find somebody better?
Someone who isn't me
'Cause I know that I was never your type
Never really your type

Overthinking's got me drinking
Messing with my head, woah

Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic
But everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart

When you said it was real
Guess I really did believe you
Did you fake how you feel
When we parked down by the river that night?
That night, that night
When we fogged up the windows in your best friend's car
'Cause we couldn't leave the windows down in December
Woah

Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin', but I'm losin' my mind

Couldn't look you in the eye

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world

You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul

(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life, I've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life
Frozen inside, without your touch, without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life, I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

I wanted you to know, I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph, I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open
And I don’t feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn and no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open
And I don’t feel like I am strong enough

Honey why you cryin’ is every-thing okay
I gotta whisper cause I can’t be too loud

Well, my girl’s in

Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin’ my name it sounds so sweet
Comin’ from the lips of an angel
Hearin’ those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It‘s funny that you’re callin’ me tonight
And yes I’ve dreamt of you too
Does he know you’re talkin’ to me
Will it start a fight?
No I don’t think she has a clue

Well, my girl’s in
The next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me

Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me

Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place

Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?
(Can you feel my heart?)

Can you help the hopeless? Well, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul, will you wait for me?
I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
Forgive me, father, I love you, mother

I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

Low now, feelin' low now
This divide inside my mind, I might lose control now
Demons feedin' on my soul, I'm a fuckin' ghost now
And there's nothin' in my chest but a fuckin' hole now

Take a look inside my eyes, got a heart of stone now

Without you have nothing left so I'mma let this pistol sing

Blood run cold like overdose
Going toe to toe with death
Smokin' 'till I'm comatose
'Till there just ain't nothin' left
Whiskey with the cyanide
Empty bottle by my bed
Depression got no antidote
So fill my fucking brain with lead

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night

Just shout whenever and I’ll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said "There's another," and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oh

I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around, and I'm like...

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh

Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't, nah

Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie

Don't you know it's time to raise our sails?
It's freedom like you never knew
Don't need bags or a pass
Say the word, I'll be there in a flash
You could say my hat is off to you

Oh we can zoom all the way to the moon
From this great wide wacky world
Jump with me, grab coins with me, oh yeah!

It's time to jump up in the air

And if the dark clouds start to swirl
Don't fear, don't shed a tear 'cause

A new world's calling out to you
Take a turn, off the path
Find a new addition to the cast
You know that any captain needs a crew

Take it in stride as you move, side to side
They're just different points of view
Jump with me, grab coins with me, oh yeah!

Come on and jump up in the air
Jump without a care
Jump up 'cause you know that I'll be there
And if you find you're short on joy
Don't fret, just don't forget that
You're still our 1-Up boy
So go on, straighten up your cap
Let your toes begin to tap
This rhythm is a power 'shroom

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh
Things you never say to me
Oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happening)

You've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit’s enough
Just a second - we’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I’ve never stopped
You’re still written in the scars on my heart
You’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust, but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No, nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh-oh, we can learn to love again
Oh-oh, can learn to love again
Oh-oh
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all


I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two


Oh, things that you say
Is it a life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know) that you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high

Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)
Hee!
Hoo!

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)

Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Oh)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breaking my heart, babe)
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover...

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

And I been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen

The story of my life
I give her hope (Give her hope)

He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day, working for her man
She brings home her pay for love, mmm, for love

She says, "We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

Woah, we're halfway there

What he used to make it talk so tough, ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away when she cries in the night
Tommy whispers, "Baby, it's okay, someday"

There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend

Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh

So I smile, pretend that everything is just fine

Like I ain't got no problems
Like I'm happy or something
Like I don't feel no darkness
Like I love being hopeless
Daylight nightmare so ferocious
Panic attacks are a bonus
My tears could fill up an ocean
Sometimes I feel no emotion

Why you always sad?

I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn, or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
"Why he by himself?"
He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand fam

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down: pussy and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

To my life, to my life, to my life…
Uh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh

So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...)

I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body

And c'mon baby (I know)
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
And c'mon baby (I know)
You said you'd find someone to take my place (Place, place)

I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep “Doin' it” and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold

I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body

Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone

I got memories (Uh), this is crazy (Uh)
She ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
I don't mean to take it out on you, baby, but I can't help it
'Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it (And I)
I apologize (For makin' you cry)
Look me in my eyes and promise you won't do me the same, yeah, yeah

I write this song as this gun is in my hand loaded
Tears rolling down my face, feel so damn hopeless
Wonder would my mom miss me? Would my dad notice?
'Cause this pressure's getting heavy and I can't hold it
No faith in people's loyalty, they damn motives
So I bottle all my issues 'til I drown choking
Lord, I know it's been a while since we've last spoken
I just hope that You forgive me for the path chosen
All this pain inside my heart, I had the drugs numb it
Rather die by my own hands than run from it
In the shadows, now the snakes are moving all around
Gave 'em all my love to find out nothing really comes from it (Comes from it)
I see I'm the villain they painted
I try to understand why they hurtin', they hatin' me
"The good die young," now that's a hell of a statement
Because the sinner does too, how the fuck can you blame me?
Look, if I look inside the mirror, I'm an empty shell
'Cause my soul been broken if you couldn't tell
All the ones I gave my love left me dyin'
Abandoned, feelin' cold, if you look closely, it's really Hell
Every time I close my eyes, I see my death
A bullet to the head or a rope around my neck
Or maybe it's the way that I've been treated, world is evil
All those traumas cuttin' deep like a knife inside my chest
But you wouldn't understand if I explained it to you
You couldn't see the picture that I painted for you
My blood is in these brush strokes, truly
All these trust issues from the way these people use me
I hear the Devil dancin' in my mind now
My heart's empty and I don't know how to cry now
They'll never know what I feel inside
There's nowhere for me to hide
And I'm just not scared to die now

Still see the pain in my eyes, but sometimes I don't feel alive, yeah
And now the tears don't fall 'cause the sinners don't cry (Sinners don't cry)
Still see the pain in my eyes, but sometimes I don't feel alive, yeah
And now the tears don't fall 'cause the sinners don't cry (Sinners don't cry)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
And now the tears don't fall 'cause the sinners don't cry (Sinners don't cry)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
And now the tears don't fall 'cause the sinners don't cry

Yeah, trust gets you killed, love gets you hurt
Bein' real gets you hated, tell me what it's worth
Pain in my heart, blood on my shirt
When it comes to suffering, I've been through the worst
I haven't seen me in the mirror in like five years
Maybe it's just 'cause I'm scared of facin' my fears
And people say they love me, but it's quite clear
I feel more love from the people in my nightmares
Sick of bein' frowned on, sick of bein' used
Sick of bein' stepped on, sick of tryna prove
Prove I'm good enough, but I just never am to you
I was born with nothing, tell me, how much can I lose?
And if you really wanna know me, I'll tell you the truth
I'm a sinner who turned cold from the pain in his youth
But my childhood trauma is not an excuse
For this alcohol and all of these drugs I abuse
The worst part is I don't even feel numb
The person that I am is who you feared that I'd become
Taste the Devil on her lips and the liquor on her tongue
Every time I start to feel okay is when I run
And life isn't reality 'til you're alone
In a dark room askin' why nowhere is home
You called, but I ain't have the heart to pick up the phone
To answer cryin', tellin' you that I'm already gone
I'm tired of waitin' and searchin' for the sun
Why should I keep hopin' when it's never gonna come?
It's been midnight my whole life, be morning when it's done
I stopped believin' in myself and put my faith into this gun
And I'll never really know if I could trust again
Might be easier for me to take my life instead
So I cock back this gun and point it to my head
Pull the trigger quick and hope one day I'll get to try again

(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Tears don't fall 'cause the sinners don't cry
Still see the pain in my eyes, but sometimes I don't feel alive, yeah
And now the tears don't fall 'cause the sinners don't cry (Sinners don't cry)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
And now the tears don't fall 'cause the sinners don't cry (Sinners don't cry)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
And now the tears don't fall 'cause the sinners don't cry (Sinners don't cry)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)
Uh

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way) from where we began
(You know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh (Uh)
Yeah (Yeah)
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yo)
When I see you again (Yo, uh)
See you again (Yo, yo)
Oh-oh (Uh-huh)
(Yup) When I see you again
 
<<Negative>>
 
When did I lose it all?
In the corner of my eyes I see you
When did we fuck it and fall?
It's always been you, always been you
Thought we'd love and grow old together
We bring out the best in each other
You made me believe we could do anything, anything

I'm letting you go for now, for now
I wanna marry you, but not now, not now

Kiss me down my neck, let's have our moment
Just before I forget what you taste like
What you feel like
Touch me like we're dying
Touch me like the first time
I was never lying, desperately trying for us
Desperately trying for us

I'm letting you go for now, for now
I wanna marry you, but not now, not now
I'm letting you go for now, for now
I wanna marry you, but not now, not now

The saddest thing of all is that I know
You're truly under my skin and that won't ever go
When you said bye a piece of me died
It left with you that night, that night
When you said bye a piece of me died
It left with you that night
We admitted it for the very first time

I'm letting you go for now, for now
I wanna marry you, but not now, not now
'Cause I'm letting you go for now, for now
I wanna marry you, but not now, not now

I see birds soaring through the clouds outside my window
Smell the fresh paint of a comfort shade on this new fall day
Feel the coffee surge through morning veins from half an hour ago
Hear the sound of shots and screams out in the hallway
Spent my last weekend camping out again down the road a ways
Just me and Joan and a couple of friends on this beautiful trail
Watched the sun slip down behind a mountain stream in these great Cascades
Saw a mighty hawk swoop down upon a stream to devour its prey
Now we’re moving chairs in some panic mode to barricade the doors
As my heart rate surges on adrenaline and nerves I feel I’ve been here before
I made it back from hell’s attack in some distant bloody war
Only to stare down hell back home
Outside my mind I wander freely past this rocky shore
Waves crash against the banks where Lewis and Clark explored
We’re all standing in the shadows of our noblest intentions of something more
Than being shot in a classroom in Oregon
It’s a morning like so many others with breakfast and birthdays
The sun burned the fog away, breeze blew the mist away
My friend Jack just had him a baby
I see birds soaring through the clouds
Outside my window today
Heaven’s calling my name from the hallway outside the door
Heaven’s calling my name from the hallway outside the door

I know I can't take one more step towards you
‘Cause all that's waiting is regret
Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

I've learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I've learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

Dear, it took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
‘Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?

Seven billion hungry ghosts
Just a parasite killing its host
The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones
But we're buried by modern misery
Modern misery

There's not enough water in the world
To wash the blood from our hands
We planted a seed, its roots will suffocate the soul
It grows without light and feeds from our bones
Hell must be empty, all the devils are here
Singing us the Lord's Prayer; finally, something that we all share

I won't go to the grave with the song still in me

What are we hiding in the rain?
This is a prison for lost souls
Another life circles the drain
We used to run with the wolves
Now we can't see the forest
'Cause there's no light in the black hole
Don't try and tell me we are blessed
We used to run with the wolves

Are these our new messiahs?
'Cause the saviour has a gun to my head
Don't be fooled by Maya, the kings are all thieves
And the serpents will bite as they please
How has it come to this?

I won't go to the grave with the song still in me
And I won't live like a slave begging from my knees

What are we hiding in the rain?

Oh, brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you
‘Cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

You could take a picture of something you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So, you take a picture of something you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done
Do
Something that's never been done

So, you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's really making any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk, let's talk

In a far and distant galaxy
Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes peer back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
He sits around inside his house
From room to room, he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out

Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
It's safe to say that

I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
The walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted
Don't waste it

Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
It's safe to say that

I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
The walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted

Here in my mind, losing my friends
Fall on my face, do it again
You say, "How do you do?"
Man, how 'bout you? Man, how 'bout you?
To be free, to be sold
To be killed, to be safe
In my head, I'm alone
I'm not dead, I'm ashamed
Just like you, I've been trying to escape
In my bones, I feel cold
I give thanks to the Lord
Industry, in the street
Let me go, let me be
I don't need to be here
I don't know, can't you see? Can't you see?

I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
These walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted
Don't waste it

This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely

I'm always so alone
Even when surrounded
By people that I know
I'm always so astounded
By my ability to ruin everything
Losing friends and starting fires
Everyone thinks I'm a liar
I always stay at home
'Cause I'm not good in public
I sit here on my phone
I'm always disappointed
I watch them live their lives
I wish that I were happy
Victim of my generation
Time machines cannot erase it

Who am I supposed to be?
When will I be complete?
When will they be proud of me?
It's getting harder to see

Slit my wrists, bloody fists
Questioning why I exist
Pain persists, evil gifts
Fucking up my life to shit
I'm worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out

I try to stay strong
No matter what I do
I'm always in the wrong
It never gets easier
But maybe that's the point
It's part of growing up
Messing up and learning from it
That's just life, it's necessary
Clinging to hope
What else is there to live for?
Got nowhere to go
What else is pain good for?
I am confident that your life has a purpose
It's okay, you will get through it
Don't give up cause someone needs you

Who am I supposed to be?
When will I be complete?
When
Will they be proud of me?
It's getting harder to see

Slit my wrists, bloody fists
Questioning why I exist
Pain persists, evil gifts
Fucking up my life to shit
I'm worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out

Please, don't give up
Gotta stay strong, gotta move on
Gotta know hope when you feel low
Please, you gotta know
That someone needs you
Please, don't give up
Gotta stay strong, gotta move on
Gotta know hope when you feel low
Please, you gotta know
That someone needs you

Slit my wrists, bloody fists
Questioning why I exist
Pain persists, evil gifts
Fucking up my life to shit
I'm worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out
Worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out

Underneath the bridge
Tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
'Cause they don't have any feelings

Something in the way, mmm

When did I become so numb?
When did I lose myself?
All the words that leave my tongue
Feel like they came from someone else

I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

When did I become so cold?
When did I become ashamed? (ohh)
Where's the person that I know?
They must have left, they must have left, with all my faith

I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

I'm paralyzed
I'm scared to live, but I'm scared to die
And if life is pain then I buried mine
A long time ago, but it's still alive
And it's takin' over me, where am I?
I wanna feel somethin', I'm numb inside
But I don't feel nothin', I wonder why
I'm in the race of life and time passed by
Look, I sit back and I watch it
Hands in my pockets
Waves come crashin' over me, but I just watch 'em
I just watch 'em
I'm underwater but I feel like I'm on top of it
I'm at the bottom and I don't know what the problem is
I'm in a box, but I'm the one that locked me in
Suffocatin' and I'm runnin' out of oxygen, ah!

I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

(I'm just so paralyzed) I'm paralyzed
(Yeah, I'm just so paralyzed) Where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things (I have no feelings)
I know I should (Oh, how come I'm not moving? Why aren't I moving?)
I'm paralyzed (Ay, yeah)
Where is the real me? (Where is the real me? Where is the real me?)
I'm lost and it kills me, (I'm paralyzed) inside (I'm paralyzed)
I'm paralyzed (I'm paralyzed)

I'm not that nice

Don't call me nice
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I've got some work to do
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off
Yeah!

Go fuck yourself
You heard me right
Don't call me nice again
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:30?
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my brains out

You die
And words don't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die

Words don't do anything

Every single day it breaks me to pieces
I tasted defeat at the feet of my demons
I’m such a fucking waste of achievement
I should put this trigger to my brain and just squeeze it
Cause Lord I know I ain't been no saint
But tell me what I did to deserve this pain
Tell me what I did to deserve this hurt
When all I ever did was put everybody first
Therapist
And how does that make you feel?
These days I just don’t feel shit
I don’t feel a thing at all, I don’t feel like I exist
Thats why I need my fix, so I can just feel something
How do you describe the word empty?
Try describe the word nothing
Wait, fuck that use my name as the definition
Write it on my forehead, defective out of commission
I’m sick of it, losing myself I’m sick of it
Check my fingerprints, you’ll see how little the percentage is

I’ve given it my all
I’ve given it my all and so much more
But everybody’s still walking out that door
I’ve given it my all
It’s getting to the point where it’s sad as fuck
I’ve given it my all but it’s not enough
It’s not enough

The sleeping pills don’t work, the healing pills don’t work
I still feel pain with the pain pills now those same pills don’t work
If I don’t get a couple percs I'm 'bout to go berserk
I swear to god nobody can fix this shit not even the church
Now  tell me what good would a pastor do? Except be mad at you
Then tell you that “you’ve sinned a bunch of times but I’ve forgiven you”
You know they won’t admit it and god himself has forbid it but it’s probably still just half of all the shit the priest committed
Therapist
And how does that mak-
Ask me one more time how the fuck I feel
Imma fucking lose my mind, step aside I need the pills
Step aside I need the xannies
Step aside I need the vicodin
And I’ll be on my way so I can just get back my life again
You do not give a shit, stop pretending stop lying
Cause to you I’m just a check, bitch just a dollar sign
Another vacay with the kids, hubby couldn’t be prouder...
And all you had to was ask me how I feel for an hour
See that’s the problem with pretentious technicalities
Your preach insanity and then expect my weekly salary?
So tell me who’s the crazy person now bitch
And yet you think you’re qualified to treat me? Shit

I’ve given it my all
I’ve given it my all and so much more
But everybody’s still walking out that door
I’ve given it my all
It’s getting to the point where it’s sad as fuck
I’ve given it my all but it’s not enough
It’s not enough

Man I came up a long way
Just a young Jozi nigga
Bullet at my temple
Afraid I might pull this trigger
This fucking anxiety
Fucking anxiety
My demons are calling and saying that they want whatever's inside of me
I'mma give it to 'em, (Hell yeah) Imma give 'em all of it
Use to be a smooth operator
Now it's the opposite
Anxiety
Oh big time
Anxiety yeah
I feel it swimming thru my veins, I’m afraid I might get the blade, make a slit and let the blood spill out
Anxiety
Oh big time
Anxiety

How could you leave so unexpected?
We waited, we waited
For you, but you just left us
We needed you, I needed you

Yo, I don't know what it's like to be addicted to pills
But I do know what it's like to be a witness, it kills
Mama told me she loved me, I'm thinkin' this isn't real
I think of you when I get a whiff of that cigarette smell, yeah
Welcome to the bottom of hell
They say pain is a prison, let me out of my cell
You say you proud of me, but you don't know me that well
Sit in my room, tears runnin' down my face and I yell
Into my pillowcases, say you comin' to get us
Then call a minute later just to tell us you're not, I'm humiliated
I'm in a room with a parent that I don't barely know
Some lady in the corner watchin' us while she's takin' notes
I don't get it, Mom, don't you want to watch your babies grow?
I guess pills are more important, all you have to say is "no"
But you won't do it, will you? You gon' keep poppin' 'til them pills kill you
I know you're gone, but I can still feel you

Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

I got this picture in my room and it kills me
But I don't need a picture of my mom, I need the real thing
Now a relationship is somethin' we won't ever have
But why do I feel like I lost somethin' that I never had?
You shoulda been there when I graduated
Told me you loved me and congratulations
Instead you left us at the window waitin'
Where you at mom?
We're too young to understand, where you at, huh?
Yeah, I know them drugs have got you held captive
I can see it in your eyes, they got your mind captured
Some say it's fun to get the high, but I am not laughin'
And what you don't realize and what you're not graspin'
That I was nothin' but a kid who couldn't understand it
I ain't gon' say that I forgive you 'cause it hasn't happened
I thought that maybe I'd feel better as time passes
If you really cared for me, then where you at then?

Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

Our last conversation, you and I sat in the livin' room
Talkin' 'bout my music and I brought you some to listen to
You started cryin', tellin' me this isn't you
A couple weeks later, guess you were singin' a different tune
You took them pills for the last time, didn't you?
They took you from us once, I guess they came back to finish you
Cryin' my eyes out in the studio is difficult
Music is the only place that I can go to speak to you
It took everything inside of me, not to scream at your funeral
Sittin' in my chair, that person talkin' was pitiful
I wish you were here, mama, but every time I picture you
All I feel is pain, I hate the way I remember you
They found you on the floor, I could tell you felt hollow
Gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
You gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
Don't know if you hear me or not, but if you're still watchin', why?

Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

Sometimes I think about like...
Sometimes I think about things like, you know
When I'd have kids, I'm like...
You won't be there, you know?
You won't be there for any of that
And I'll never get to see you again
Sometimes I wish I would've just called you
I wish I would have just picked up the phone
Wish you were here
I mean you should've been there for us
You should have been here!
Them pills got you, right?!
Them pills got you, right?!
I wish you were here
 
<<Negative>>
 
This is what I get for having expectations
Cause I forgot where I came from
What if I’m gone will you wake up?
Would it then all make you wake up?

Hey mama, just wanted to tell you I love you
Don’t know if I say it enough
But I’ve been really prayin’ for us
And I thank god for you
Man, I look up to you, man
If I was in trouble, I need somebody I run to you (yeah)
If I never told you, you was my idol like really my idol
Whatever you said to me I took it in, like it was the bible
When you look at me, I wanna know, the feelin’ inside you
I guess sometimes I just wonder if you feel the way I do
Remember my 10th birthday, when you apologized
You couldn’t buy cake so you bought me McDonalds fries
I thanked you but you got my brother gifts a lot of times
For me you say can use some time, but never got the time
I figured it was for the bills, but for real how you really feel
I know this birthday around tax time so is that what it is
I just really think it’s fucked up, but I guess it is what it is
Remember recitals, I played the piano, I waited and you never came
You said you was working
But got home from work for my brother, and went to every game
He never even really scored, but you was just there to support
But I know basketball is more fun to watch than piano, I’m sure
I really forgive you!
And Imma’ continue forgiving you
I made up a whole lot of reasons, cuz’ I know it can’t be intentional
When I was in the hospital, you said you hope I got better
When he was down to weather, you was in the hospital till he got better
I don’t understand
When you look at me I feel like you regret me
But the look inside your eyes when you see him sometimes affect me
I was tryin’ to be perfect, just to feel like you accept me
I love the way you love, but you love everyone except me
Be honest, Mom!
When nobody come through for you, I’m present
But when Christmas comes around you don’t think to give me a present
Man, that’s fucked up
Cuz’ I spent my whole life tryna impress you
But I guess I ain't’ really special

This is what I get for having expectations
Cause I forgot where I came from
What if I’m gone will you wake up?
Would it then all make you wake up?

You really showed me how much a parent could love their child
So much that they forget they got another child
Man, my whole life I just wanted to make my mother proud
One day if you see the difference, when I can’t come around

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why

It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore
 
<<Negative>>
 
They wanna tear you down, but they don't want you to be down
Gettin' caught up, makes you feel dizzy
I'll be honest with you
Alright
Fuck it!

Another day (Another day), another night (Another night)
Another fucking battle in my mind
A lotta love (Lotta love), a lotta hate (Lotta hate)
A lot who want to see me unwind
I feel alone (Feel alone), all alone (All alone)
"Now get your shit together" is what I'm told
Been feelin' low (Feelin' low), super low (Super low)
And they won't even care 'til I'm ghost (Yeah)

Used to dream of the top, had nightmares at the bottom
'Til I realized at the bottom is the top when forgotten
Pray I don't fall, like autumn
When you feel more like a product than a person, there's a problem
Been feelin' so low, I don't want no one to know
I just need somethin' to cope
Leave me alone, told 'em all, "Leave me alone"
Then wonder, "Where do they go?"
Been here before, push away people I love
Just so they never get close
End of my rope, I don't think anyone care
Maybe they will when I go
Maybe they'll talk about me on the internet ('Net)
They never care, only care when they benefit (Yeah)
Introvert honestly out of my element (Yeah)
Still I'm afraid of becoming irrelevant (Oh, yeah)
Pay attention to the ones who don't clap when you win
If they lie to you once, then they'll do it again
Knew the hurt would come back, I just didn't know when
And the night of the crash, I thought it was the end
All it takes is a moment to alter a life
And I thought about that for the rest of the night
Am I makin' a difference with things that I write?
Just a human, you don't know the demons I fight, so—

Another day (Another day), another night (Another night)
Another fucking battle in my mind
A lotta love (Lotta love), a lotta hate (Lotta hate)
A lot who want to see me unwind
I feel alone (Feel alone), all alone (All alone)
"Now get your shit together" is what I'm told
Been feelin' low (Feelin' low), super low (Super low)
And they won't even care 'til I'm ghost (Yeah)

You say I'm the worst
They say I'm the best
But call me tonight when you get off of work
Got things on my chest
I've been feeling bad for the feelings I have
I know that I'm blessed
Been learning that money just isn't the cure
For feeling depressed, I know I digress
I've been a mess, honestly, I've been a mess
Hate what I think in my head
Act like a friend, then when I need you the most
That's when you leave me on read
Have to pretend, always just have to pretend
Like I don't care what it said
Stuck in my head, plenty of things I could do
I just go lay in my bed, damn
Don't really know why I'm feelin' so low (Low)
Where do you go when there's nowhere to go? (Go)
They talk and they talk and I know they don't know (Know)
What it's like when your heart becomes empty and cold
How do I know what's real when my mind questions all I know?
How do I save myself from myself when I'm feelin' low?
How do I flip the page if I'm stuck reading what I've wrote?
Why do I always drown in my thoughts?
Need to learn to float

Another day (Another day), another night (Another night)
Another fucking battle in my mind
A lotta love (Lotta love), a lotta hate (Lotta hate)

Now the night is coming to an end, ooh
The sun will rise and we will try again, ooh

I will fear the night again, ooh
I hope I'm not my only friend, ooh

What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call (Call, call, call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)

What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, "How could he go if he's got everything?
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king"

Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call

Promise me this (Call, call)
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
(Ooh, call, ooh, call)

Neon gravestones try to call

'Cause they won't get them
No, they won't get them
They won't get them
But they won't get them

Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking "I'll teach them"
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated
 
<<Negative>>
 
Nobody thinks what I think, nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy, I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, my catastrophe at my kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me
Okay, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something, and it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons, meaning
Maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend

Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say they know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say they don't know you
And neither do I, so here's a prime example of a stand up guy who
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother, and his head's screwed up, but that's all right

Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are frenemies, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone

Leave me alone
Don't leave me alone

Spent the day with my dad
And his old friend, Jim Wise
He's on house arrest
And he sits around inside
We brought him food from Panera Bread
The snoring sun rolled out of bed
He talked about his '90 Corvette
His warehouse job and his knee replacement

Jim Wise mercy-killed his wife
In a hospital at her bedside
Then he put the gun to his head
And it jammed and he didn't die
Awaits trial all summer long
And his eyes welled up when he told us
About how much she loved the backyard garden
And the budding rosebush

She loved the garden
And its budding rosebush
Spent the day with my dad
And his friend, Jim Wise

Spent the day with my dad
And his old friend, Jim Wise
He's got a big, thick ankle bracelet
And he can't go outside
He's got a long white Amishman's beard
And a catheter
And he'll be headed to Mansfield Prison
By the end of the year, for sure
His shelves are sticky, old, ratty books
His albums are The Doors and Stevie Nicks
His kitchen cabinets are full of baked beans
His TV is silent, words flash across the screen
And he stares off into dead air

Jim Wise killed his wife out of love for her
At her bedside
And then, he put the gun to his head
But he failed at suicide
His trial's coming up in the fall
And he sighed when we stepped out and we left
And I pointed out the pretty cardinal
Perched on the empty birdbath

The bright red cardinal
The empty birdbath
I spent today with my dad
And his friend, Jim Wise

There is no self to kill
A city of gardens
I'm going to kill my self
To kill my self
To kill my self
I'm going to kill my self
So there won't be nothing left
I'm going to remove my self
Remove myself
Remove myself
I'm going to remove my self
So there won't be nothing left
Because you are everyone you hate
When you're asleep or awake
All the choices you've made
You are everyone you hate
And it is ruining your life

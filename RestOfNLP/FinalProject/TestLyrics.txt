
 
Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land

Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land


Now, I lay me down to sleep (Now, I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
And if I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land (yeah, haha haha)

Oh, yeah-yeah, yo
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
 
<<Sentimental>>
 
Voices call
They call out my name, my name, my name
They say I'm different
Well I'm not the same, the same
You say you want to, ah, be like me
Well, boy, let me tell you…
You don't know what I've seen
They say a devil lives in my soul
I promise not to let him take control

I'm mindin' my own business
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong

Shadows follow so close behind me
I look in the mirror…
I don't like what I see
Whoa, God, can't you help me
Get outta here? Here
I feel like I'm living
Deep in Hell

I'm mindin' my own business
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong

I'm mindin' my own business!
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong!

Now I said that
I, I'm mindin'
I'm mindin' my own, own
I ain't doing nothin' wrong
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong
Nothin' wrong

Howling winds keep screaming around
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back
Night crawler

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers our last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back
Night crawler


As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind

Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
Come to me it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back
Night crawler

He's going to get you
He's going to get you
Beware of the beast
Night crawler
Beware of the beast
He's going to get you
Night crawler
Straight out of hell
Beware of the beast
He's going to get you

In her place, one hundred candles burning
Her salty sweat drips from her breast
Her hips move and I can feel what they're sayin', swayin'
They say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...
Yeah...
Black lipstick stains her glass of red wine
I am your servant, may I light your cigarette?
Those lips move, yeah, I can feel what you're sayin', prayin'
They say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...
I beg to serve, your wish is my law
Now close those eyes and let me love you to death
Shall I prove I mean what I'm sayin', beggin'
I say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...
Ah...

Did you never give a damn in the first place?
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'Cause in the interest of all involved, I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty…

Man nearly killed me, steppin' where you fear to tread
Stop, drop and roll - you were dead from the git-go!
Big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker
Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought
Always is, and never was
Foundation made of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear ya - think I fear you? Bullshit!
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit
Is there any way to break through the noise?
Was it something that I said that got you bent?
Gotta be that way if you want it
Sanity, literal profanity - hit me!

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lot of rumor fodder
Keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realize
Step up, fairy
I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome straight to the dome
You heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter
And if you know what's good just shut up and beg, brother
Backstab - don't you know who you're dissin'?
Sideswipe - we know the ass that you're kissin'!

Biggity-biggidy bitch boy, halfway houser
Don't hear shit 'cause it keeps gettin' louder
Come up and you get a face full o' tactic
Lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket
You got no pull, no power, no nothin'
Now you start shit? Well ain't that somethin'?
Payoffs don't protect, and you can hide if you want
But I'll find you - comin' up behind you!

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

'Bout time I set this record straight
All the needlenose punchin' is makin' me irate
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
Where you gonna be in the next five years?
The crew and all the fools and all the politics
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got dick when they passed out the good stuff
Bam - are you sick of me? Good enough - had enough
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!

I'll breathe you in with smoke in the backyard light
We used to laugh until we choked, into the wasted nights
It was the best time of my life, but now I sleep alone
So don't, don't, don't wake me up, cause my thrill is gone
Say I'm wrong in the sunset turning red behind the smoke
Forever and alone
Yeah

And you've gone and sewn me to this bed
The taste of you and me will never leave my lips again
Under the blinding rain
I wanna hold your hand so tight, I'm gonna break my wrists
And when the vultures sing tonight, I'm gonna join right in

I'll sing along, (Oh, oh, oh)
Because I don't know any other song
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
And now there's nothing to do but scream at the drunken moon

This isn't fair, no, don't you try to blame this on me
My love for you was bulletproof, but you're the one who shot me
And goddammit, I can barely say your name
So, I'll try to write it and fill the pen with blood from the sink
Woah. Oh
But, don't just say it, you should sing my name
Pretend that it's a song because forever, it's yours
And we can sing this on the way home

I'll sing along, (Oh, oh, oh)
Cause I don't know any other song
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
But, there's nothing to do, but tear my voice apart
There's nothing to do, but scream at the drunken moon

This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left

'Cause you know
You know, you know

I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of Hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all, I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up

'Cause you know
You know, you know

I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore

So far away (So far away)
Been far away for far too long
So far away (So far away)
Been far away for far too long

But you know
You know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you (I love you)
I loved you all along
And I forgive you (I forgive you)
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me, and never let me go
Keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me, never let me go

Keep breathing
Hold on to me, never let me go

Hold on to me, never let me go

Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

On the verge of no return, why'd you keep fucking it up?
Don't wanna have to bury you, but nothing seems to get through your skull
One day the only butterflies left will be in your chest
As you march towards your death, breathing your last breath
I hate to say "I told you so," but look how the bruises show

Tell me, how's it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
How did I let you sink your fangs so deep? Ah
You know you can't breathe on your own

Past the point of rescuing, why'd I keep pushing my luck?
The hole I wore into your soul has got too big to overlook
One day the only butterflies left will be in our chests
As we march towards our death, breathing our last breath
I thought we had a future, but we ain't got a chance in hell

So tell me, how's it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
I let you sink your fangs so deep, ah
You know you can't breathe on your own
You know I can't breathe on my own
How can you breathe on your own?
How can I breathe on my own?

Oh, oh-oh-oh, the sun is setting on our love, I fear
Letting our loneliness out into the atmosphere
The tide is turning on our chance to turn it 'round
I never thought I'd see my fingernails fall out
Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air
Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air

Take it, take it out of the equation
I just need a little isolation
Take it, take it out of the equation
I just wanna be alone
Stumble and sink like a stone
Thought this was all that I need
Always ending up alone
Maybe I was born to bleed
Take it away, take it away (I’ve always been)
Running away, running away (I’ll never stop)
Losing my faith, losing my faith
You’ll never get the best of me
Over and over, I lost my way
Will I finally make amends with the time I spent in vain?
I can’t escape my own suffering
Is it this life that’s getting old?
Despair’s a lonely hand to hold
Take your time
I’ll give you one more chance to say goodbye
Over and over, I lost my way
You’ve taken advantage of my darkest days
I won’t let it take me. I won’t let it stay
Over and over, I lost my way
It’s even harder to let go. Why am I so afraid?
You never really ran away from...
You’re never in it for the long run
Tell me why I’m still just standing here?
Take it away, take it away (I’ve always been)
Running away, running away (I’ll never stop)
Losing my faith, losing my faith
You’ll never get the best of me
Over and over, I lost my way
Will I finally make amends with the time I spent in vain?
Over and over, I lost my way
You’ve taken advantage of my darkest days
I won’t let it take me. I won’t let it stay
Over and over, I lost my way
Forget my name
Watch me as I fade away like an unmarked grave
Run away
Turn away from my mistakes
Does it sound like
Does it sound just like defeat?
All I know - this life is getting old
Breathing in again, tell myself it’s not the end
Take your time
I’ll give you one more chance to say goodbye
Come closer, it’s over
Forget my name
You’ll fade away just like an unmarked grave
And I’ll do the same
Over and over, I lost my way
You’ve taken advantage of my darkest days
I won’t let it take me. I won’t let it stay
Over and over, I lost my way
Over and over
Come closer, it’s over
Breathing in again, tell myself it’s not the end

just an average girl
she always wore a smile
she was cheerful and happy for a short while
now shes older things are getting colder
life's not what she thought
she wished someone had told her
she told you she was down
you let it slip by
so from then on she kept it on the inside
she told herself she was alright
but she was telling white lies
can't you tell, look at her dull eyes
tried to stop herself from crying almost every night
but she knew there was no chance of feeling alright
summer came by, all she wore was long sleeves
'cause those cuts on her wrist were bleeding through you see
she knew she was depressed she didn't want to admit it
didn't think she fit in, everyone seemed to miss it
she carried on like a soldier with a battle wound
bleeding out from every cut her body consumed
she had no friends at school, all alone she sat
and if someone were to notice she would blame the cat
but those cuts on her wrist they were no mistake
but no one cared enough to save her from this self hate
things were going down, never really up
and here she is now stuck in this stupid rut
she knew exactly what she had to do next
just stand on the chair and tie the rope around her neck
She wrote a letter with her hands shaking wild,
"Look at me now are you proud of your precious child?"
But she knew that her parents weren't the ones to blame,
It was the world that should bow down it's head in shame
She stood up on the chair and looked out at the moon,
Just don't think it'll all be over soon
The chair fell down as she took her final breath,
It's all over all gone, now she's greeting death
Her mum walks in, she falls down to the floor,
And now nothing can take back what she just saw
The little girl that she raised is just hanging there,
Her body's pale and her face is violently bare,
She sees the note and unfolds it with care,
All she does is stare, "How can this be fair?"
She starts reading as the tears roll down her face,
"I'm sorry Mum, but this world is just not my place,
I've tried for so long to fix this and fit in,
I've come to realise this world's full of sin,
There's nothing for me here, I'm just a waste of space,
I've got no reason to stay here with this awful race,
It's a disgrace, I was misplaced,
Born in the wrong time and in the wrong place,
It's ok though, 'cause you'll see me soon,
You'll know when your time has come, just look at the moon,
As it shines bright, throughout the night,
And remember everyone's facing their own fights,
But i can't deal with this pain, I'm not a fighter,
You'll make it through the night, just hug your pillow tighter
So let the world know that I died in vain,
Because the world around me is the one to blame,
And I know in a year you'll forget I'm gone,
'Cause I'm not really something to be dwelled on,
That's what they used to tell me, all those kids at school,
So I'm going by the law majority rules,
My presence on this earth is not needed any longer,
And if anything I hope this makes you stronger,
You're the best friend that I ever had,
Such a shame I had to make you so very sad,
Just remember that you meant everything to me,
And to my heart, you're the only one that held the key,
Now it's time to go I'm running out of space to write,
And yes I lost my fight, but please just hold on tight
I'm watching over you from the clouds above,
And sending down the purest and whitest dove,
To watch over you and be my helpful eye,
So this is it world...
Goodbye!"

Sleep on me, feel the rhythm in my chest, just breathe
I will stay so the lantern in your heart won't fade

The secrets you tell me, I'll take to my grave
There's bones in my closet, but you hang stuff anyway
And if you have nightmares, we'll dance on the bed
I know that you love me, love me
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head

Kiss my lips, feel the rhythm of your heart and hips
I will pray so the castle that we've built won't cave

The secrets you tell me, I'll take to my grave
There's bones in my closet, but you hang stuff anyway
And if you have nightmares, we'll dance on the bed

A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself atlast he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, oh in a box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet

He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits," yeah

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet

There once was a man who just couldn't cry
He hadn't cried for years and for years
Napalmed babies and the movie Love Story
For instance, could not produce tears
As a child he had cried as all children will
Then at some point his tear ducts ran dry
He grew to be a man, the feces hit the fan
Things got bad, but he couldn't cry
His dog was run over, his wife up and left him
And after that he got sacked from his job
Lost his arm in the war, was laughed at by a whore
Ah, but still not a sniffle or sob
His novel was refused, his movie was panned
And his big Broadway show was a flop
He got sent off to jail; you guessed it, no bail
Oh, but still not a dribble or drop
In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
And made to make license plates
Water and bread was all he was fed
But not once did a tear stain his face
Doctors were called in, scientists, too
Theologians were last and practically least
They all agreed sure enough; this was sure no cream puff
But in fact an insensitive beast
He was removed from jail and placed in a place
For the insensitive and the insane
He played lots of chess and made lots of friends
And he wept every time it would rain
Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried
On the forty-first day, he passed away
He just dehydrated and died
Well, he went up to heaven, located his dog
Not only that, but he rejoined his arm
Down below, all the critics, they took it all back
Cancer robbed the whore of her charm

His ex-wife died of stretch marks, his ex-employer went broke
The theologians were finally found out
Right down to the ground, that old jail house burned down
The earth suffered perpetual drought

Please believe these CDs and sheets will bring me peace like treaties
Heebie jeebies my species bring evil deeds like a Ouija
Eating Greasy but sure as the leaves are green we defeat these
And I believe cause trees came from planting seeds in the fecees
Tho I got pro ambition this liquor help me speakeasy
The bees knees thinking I'm sweet means diabetes
Police see me bleeding as growth like bowls of wheeties
Jesus pieces needed no preaching slinging the pcp please see me
Yak yak put the coniac in a black Bag
Sip it in the back of a rag tag ac that's
All I could afford til I'm poppin on ascap
Test me get crossed out twice like hash tag
New dark knights coming like Affleck
You seen it once maybe twice like a snap chat
Never run for my life that's a back track
And all my niggas stay strapped team back pack
Uh I can beat the sun in a stare off
I can be the one in a pair off
You probably shoot a layup get an air ball
Horse stance crane stance uh nigha  bear claw
Impair snares flares make the air cough
Quitting once you see me that's a fair call
Don't you ever leave your girl around me nigha I be all up in that pussy like a hair ball

No matter how you flip Denzil, Os and Chris know it's still a slaughter
All the rn's know d.o.c's what the doctor ordered
O.C.D., see we been cleansing the game so fuck a disorder
Lethal weapons when we penning, C, O, D, no console needed
My p.o.v is G-o-d's e.k.g, the heart beat of a martyr
More souls then a. million men marching/ Darwin evolved this Oswin to Martin
Star gazing now a day/ is the same as looking in a mirror
All blue Yankee like I’m Hova, the brim is grey from new era
The sky is grey and cup overfloweth with me new errors
The new mistakes that I'm making cuz winnings what os.wins scared of
My soul my peace of mind and the industry had a stare off
Close to the cliff like Clair Huxtable (God I hope I don't steer off)
Autumn know I'm the son of the summer scorching the fall
Pallbearer, bearing this gift of vitality for ya
The ghost of Christopher Wallace just tried to drown me in the holy water/
Slapped me out of my christening so I face the palms of big poppa
The palms of this author orchestrates psalms for mobsters
Songs for contraband where the swinging hands like black conductor
Songs in the key of a 1,000 grams on a grand piano
Sonically This dope is superb enough to revive Seattle/
Hey man this rain man/ (poor) pour enough to throw a sea.at you
‘Cuz I'm tide( tired)/ of the current
The people lookin at me. And feel. He (Philly)/ stands. firms.for all he believes like a rocky statue
D. you ever do fall. off heathes. Ledge I know the lord Got you

But oz, if i do i really hope its a clear fall/
Careful
When i go off/
Niggas lose more
Than pierre paul/

It's a clear call
With these bear claws
I yank a bitch like wierd all

Man im smoked thought
(you mean smoked out)
But im back in the zone when/
The track, hit the gas i attract to the tone then/
I attack, like im in a parking lot with a tat that said bad to the bone then
Put out when im going in/
And these bars so enlarged in my noggin, surprise im disguised, in real life im a cone head/
They try tell me dont curse, all you hear is beep beep beep you would swear a nigga going dead/
But thank you thank you, so kindly, there screaming loudly
Black actor as human torch they finally made a movie bout me
Black magic for haters, friendships thats forged when they truly doubt me/
I had it of lately, pouting bout cowards thats making, /
The culture a place thats
Deserted of knowledge and patience/
The doctors acknowledge no patience, they just say take this/
Pill
Kill yourself slowly and painless/
But this that piss up in the morning
Don't forget where your aim is/
Dont forget what yo names is...
You could call me balthasar, and dont forget who i came with/
Words, concepts and bars, 3 wise men we the latest/
We the latest closest to gods and we bring gifts from the savior/
In reality we are the stars, that come out when you say save us/
From darkness
The haters, game has, been infiltrated by traitors
Now play ya
Cards right before somebody take em and trade em/
Or pawn em
Im taking limbs too im vietnamin/
Im fly and im intercoming
My niggas oswin or chris rivers  bomb em/

I told J I'm two cool L's away from a Kangol
A whip away from django/
A critics opinion away to losing my ear like a Van Gogh/
A starving artist. Under unemployment. Coining phrases/ hoping he has enough on pump 87 to make this Van Go/
At least rite.aid/
I'm tired of riding around commando/
Sorry if that's too. Much. Info/
Mation for y'all to handle/
Two other wise men aside a me know.that I'm los.ing/
The soul in me try.ing to prove.that/

More then a couple scriptures/
This misconception is brewing/
A Jesus escariot/
I purposely didn't say judas/
I know what I'm doing/
I'm simply stating I'm human/
I'll take shot of tequila with the same lips I use for communion nigga/
I send a prayer and do the shooting nigga/
I'm not concious
I'm un.conscious
I read the book James. And still.get. Neck like an ostrich
A prostitute and a prophet
Nigga
I came with with two other wise men to body you niggas

Young monster marcher that conjured karma to conquer
Dishonor leads to arms swinging razor blades like a barber
Diminish your soul and image like armored trucks to a Tonka
Willy wonka chompas gap in every tooth like Moses part the
Oceans I'm chosen tho holding clothes that was thrown in holes like I'm Oscar
Larger and darker than life's price which I ponder
Cause poppa died but hold it down my momma  get your moms snuffed
The Type to set a stance and move a mountain with a palm thrust

Uhm just, know that they can't calm us/
In hip hop, we don't shoot if you put your arms up/
Keep in mind my mind is too meraculous marvelouse/
I don't let nuttin by me, guess my minds like a contra- septive
Yes it's , who your girl want to get with/
I left her pussy red, but left her blue guess i set tripped/ uh
(You went through all of that with her)
Now she falling back nigga/
(she wanta netflix and chill)
But we skipped all of that nigga/
Now im, left with this pitty, all my ex's are pretty/
But only time my ex is up is when im repping my city/
My weapons a pen and a pad and when im prepping i shimmy
Im doing a dance like im diddy
Bad boy with the pimmy
Thats uptown slang, that soured
Because i come from the north
You see i always come in first you built to last like a ford/
And on my, last i afford
To get past and move forward
Relaxed then relapse but in fact I just came back like a chord
The spinal
Can't do what i do
My rhymes are from times of vinyls/
And ciphers come at your vitals
With rivals who try to fight you
Or knife you so bring your rifle
Your wisdom and bring your bible
Don't be shook, don't bring your rap book, just bring your title/
Gotta buzz right?
(Yea)
You got some thugs right
(yea)
Maybe you could sign your bugged life here/
You got my bud right
(Yea)
You got my bud light?
(here)
...where the fuck you get this buzz light year?
Hold up, we are are no colly bones/
We over heads like carry ons/
When i kick it, i take one to the face, i call it holly holmes/
Then i be gone/ im out like a stale mate/
I got the kinda drive, that nobody could tailgate/
Could tell fake, haters, fuck you , you could blow me/
Even in real life i leave the hating comments below me/
You know i gotta keep going, until they sick of it/
Until my pen is selling (penicillin) so strong, they could use that shit to kill syphillis/

And cure this infinite imminent fall of man with these intricate flipped lyrics like siscor kicks that's been given a gift foretold like a syllabus
Tried to reach for the stars but your bars are icharus
My ligaments propel me to heights so blow me like instruments
Ironic nighas writtens are sounding like they're illiterate
I hit the liquor with spliffs rolled from a bit of Leviticus
While we breaching the boarders and porters order some immigrants
And I'm just looking for fellow lyricists  I can nigga wit
Modern day bastards with a passion rap words like a pastor
Add verbs to my verses create disasters
Cause with the world on my shoulders when I walk I collapse earth
And all my nighas is raw like war backwards
Three wise men ain't taking no losses with oswins and King Kong ain't got nothing on Denzel so we flowing like rivers birthing leviathans higher than firemen admiring burnt down trap houses taking after whifs of that finer blend
I am him we are they and no ones blessed with nicer
We're dogs you're cats with no rats like someone stressed the piper
Three wise men with a gift for your flesh in diapers
Even if you trained til you're grown you couldn't best this cypher challenge

I find it's funny how a smile can hide a broken heart
And how the masking of your feelings is a secret art
Would you have seen this coming?
I know she hides it well
The whole world is really under this girls tragic spell
Thinking nothing of the glare in her big brown eyes
Little do they know, they're a great disguise
She wakes up, watches the sunrise
Starts reeling off the bucket loads of sad lies
"Are you alright?"
"Yes" she replies
No one can hear the scream of her internal cries
She thinks there's no hope and no faith left to give
Feels no reason and no purpose for her soul to live
How could you take this girl, and make her feel secure
Then go grab your mates and make her feel impure?
Cause now she's damaged forever and her thoughts are stained
With every memory you gave her you should be ashamed
Did you like it when you heard her screaming out in pain?
I bet the thought of it is driving her insane
One of the worst crimes that you could commit
And for what? Just for your own selfish benefit
And now she's thinking "Do I even deserve to live?"
Cause what you did there is no way she could forgive
She was so innocent until that event
You made an indent on her present
Now she's forced to travel down her life on this path
Guess you really didn't think of the aftermath
Was it intentional?
Are you delusional?
Did you understand what you were doing at all?
What a waste of such a precious girl I will admit
You took advantage of her and now you've ruined it
And I just hope that one day she will recover
And a genuine smile she will discover
Sometimes the outside it don't mean a thing
Cause this girl she's beautiful when you start digging in
And I'll admit that there's nothing left to say
But I promise that everything will be okay
And just remember that I'm here for you whenever
It's gonna be that way with us forever
Cause you know that I'm never really very far
And you hear this song you'll know who you are
So I hope you cherish the words that I wrote for you
And I admire you for everything you've been through
You are stronger than you'd ever know I promise you
Just think back at all those awful things,you know it's true
You're still standing here
Healthy and alive
And if you truly believe
I know that you'll survive

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine


She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine


Oh yeah! Woah-oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah
Ooh! Sweet love of mine


Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ooh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go now?
Where do we go? (Sweet child...)
Ooh, where do we go now?
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Where do we go now? Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, wow
Where do we go?
Oh, where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ooh, where do we go now?
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Sweet child, sweet child o' mine

Backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways."
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this


Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."
So I took a big chance at the high school dance

"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"

Just give me a kiss
Like this

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open; why were they open? (Ooh)

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no, oh-oh-oh

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face, then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash; yes, you did!
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

But darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain

No, you won't do the same

Ooh, you'd never do the same

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
When you let her go
Whoa

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

If you lookin' for me, you can find Wiz
In a new car or the crowd with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
Ain't no other squad I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say? Tell me what you say
Workin' hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, lookin' out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob, all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

I never feared death or dyin' (Woo)
I only fear never tryin' (Woo) (Uh)
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now

One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with (I ride or die for mine)
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with? (I ride or die for love)
This moment, we own it

This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside, uh
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plug, so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit (Uh)

Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say some
One thing about it: got a problem? I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with (I ride or die for mine)
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with? (I ride or die for love)
This moment, we own it

Hahaha
Uh
This moment, we own it
I ride or die for mine
I'm ride or die material
One life to live, so here we go
This moment, we own it

First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King would'a been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
"I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop bop bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop bop bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow
She shallow
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow (Yeah, ayy)
She shallow
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow
She shallow
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow
She shallow

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

Hun, and as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
‘Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends!
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends, yeah

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

I don't need anything (Yeah) to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
‘Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time

Yeah, and I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go ape shit
Say "Fuck y'all!" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it—tell me now, isn't it funny? (Nah)

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

I don't need anything (Yeah) to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
‘Cause the music fills me good
And it gets me every time

Like, ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba

Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
‘Cause the music fills me good
And it gets me every time

Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
Pray to Lord my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great, but I'm broke as hell
Havin' dreams that I'm foldin' cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah, it's no debate
Yeah

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

I don't need anything (Yeah) to get me through the night

Ha ha ha ha, this is about you

Beware, beware, be skeptical
Of their smiles, their smiles of plated gold
Deceit so natural
But a wolf in sheep's clothing is more than a warning
Baa baa, black sheep, have you any soul?
No sir, by the way, what the hell are morals?
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jill's a little whore and her alibis are turning tricks

So could you
Tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day (one day)
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

Aware, aware, you stalk your prey
With criminal mentality
You sink your teeth into the people you depend on
Infecting everyone, you're quite the problem
Fee-fi-fo-fum, you better run and hide
I smell the blood of a petty little coward
Jack be lethal, Jack be slick
Jill will leave you lonely dying in a filthy ditch

So could you
Tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day (one day)
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

Maybe you'll change, abandon all your wicked ways
Make amends and start anew again
Maybe you'll see all the wrongs you did to me
And start all over, start all over again

Who am I kidding? Now, let's not get overzealous here
You've always been a huge piece of shit
If I could kill you, I would, but it's frowned upon in all fifty states
Having said that, burn in hell!

Oh, oh, oh, so tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day (one day)
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

Karma's gonna come collect your debt (oh, oh, oh)
Karma's gonna come collect your debt
Jazzy!

You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it
Not when you go down
'Cause this is my game, and you better come to play
I used to hold my freak back, now I'm letting go
I make my own choice
Bitch, I run this show
So leave the lights on
No, you can't make me behave

(Oh-oh-oh)
So, you say I'm complicated
That I must be out my mind
But you've had me underrated-rated-rated

What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being

Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night I toss and I turn, and I dream of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
Larger than life

Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night...

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood)

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'tll the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night

Ay
Otra vez
Sentado aquí en la esquina donde no me ves
¿Será que otro tequila ayudará esta vez?
¿Será que voy a hablarte o pasará otra vez la misma estupidez?
Bailando frente a mí en cámara lenta, ey
Sonando una canción de los noventa
Y antes de que me arrepienta

Quiero decírtelo en secreto con una canción (Ey)
No estoy borracho, lo prometo
Pero tú eres perfecta (Tú eres perfecta)
Tú eres perfecta, pero no te has dado cuenta
Quiero decírtelo de frente sin explicación
El amor llega de repente
Y es que tú eres perfecta (Tú eres perfecta; woh-woh)
Tú eres perfecta, yeah-yeah (Laramercy gang)

(Pri-yah-yah, ¡Farru!)
Con la nota que tengo, siento que te estoy viendo 20/20 (¡Blep!)
La visión perfecta, bebecita, tú a mí me daña' la mente
Tú ere' una abusadora, cuando lo menea' tú me enamora'
Quiero que me haga' la batidora (Pum-pum-pum-pum)
Y lo que vaya' a hacer, vamo' a hacerlo ahora y (¡Blep!)
Dale lento, métele violento
Guáyame sin miedo y dale movimiento
Déjame sentirte, pegarme a tu cuerpo
Y cuando tú te dobla', qué rico te siento
Me vo'a dar otro trago, a ver
Pa' ver si yo 'toy viendo bien
Porque cada' ve' que te miro má' ricota tú te ve' (Blep, blep)
Y me vo'a dar otro trago, a ver
Pa' ver si yo 'toy viendo bien
Porque cada' ve' que te miro má' ricota tú te ve' (Fa-rru)

Quiero decírtelo en secreto con una canción
No estoy borracho, lo prometo
Pero tú eres perfecta (Tú eres perfecta)
Tú eres perfecta, pero no te has dado cuenta
Quiero decírtelo de frente sin explicación
El amor llega de repente
Y es que tú eres perfecta (Tú eres perfecta)
Tú eres perfecta (Pu-pu-pu-pum; pri-yah-yah-yah; ¡Farru!; ¡blep!)

Un shots, do' shots, tre' shots (¡Blep!)
Un poco de sal, limón y tequila (¡Blep!)
Móntate en mi nota, baby, vacila
'Tá saliendo el sol y no se acaban la' pila (Farru)
Y aquí salimo' rulay
Andamo' con la nota prendía' en high
Yo nunca había visto un booty 'e tu size
Y ya quiero darte ra-pa-pa-pai (Pu-pu-pu-pum; ey)

Quiero que sepas que me gustas, girl (Yeah-eh)
Despué' de aquí, dime qué vamo' a hacer
Yo te quiero comer, tú 'tá a otro nivel (Yah-yah)
Pa' mí tú 'tá perfecta, mujer (Guayo, guaye)
Quiero que sepas lo que siento con esta canción
Y emborracharme con tu cuerpo en una noche perfecta
Porque tú eres perfecta, perfecta, perfecta, baby

Quiero decírtelo de frente sin explicación
El amor llega de repente
Y es que tú eres perfecta (Tú eres perfecta)
Tú eres perfecta (Oh; no), para mi corazón, yeah (Oh; wuh)

Luis Fonsi
Báilalo, báilalo

I only love you in the middle of the night
That’s when you run my mind
Every time I get the feeling I can't fight
And I know it just ain't right
Al borde de perderte otra vez
Ahora que estás tan dentro de mi piel
No sé qué puedo hacer si estás con él
But for now we're just pretend

Me avisa' cuando tú quiera'
Haré como si no existiera'
Sigo aquí en tu lista de espera, yey-ieh
Yeah I ,gotta love but I'm involved
Yeah, I made a choice so it's my fault
Staring at a problem we can't solve (Uh-uh-uh-uh)

Tal vez es pasión (Es pasión)
Darte sin condición (Condición)
Calmar esta adicción (Esta adicción)
Llámalo amor

Never kiss and tell, that's a no, no
Got it so good never let go, oh-oh

She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall

She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night

She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life, but she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain, come on!

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (Come on!)
Livin' la vida loca (Come on!)
She's livin' la vida loca

Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill

She never drinks the water, makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her, you'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane (Come on!)

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down

Her lips are devil red

Something flavored, Aventura
Hello?
Shh, sólo escucha

Son las cinco 'e la mañana y yo no he dormido nada
Pensando en tu belleza, en loco voy a parar
El insomnio es mi castigo, tu amor será mi alivio
Y hasta que no seas mía no viviré en paz
Hoy conocí tu novio, pequeño y no buen mozo
Y sé que él no te quiere, por su forma de hablar
Además, tú no lo amas, porque él no da la talla
No sabe complacerte como lo haría yo
Pero tendré paciencia, porque él no es competencia
Por eso no hay motivos, para yo respetarlo

No, no es amor
Lo que tú sientes se llama obsesión
Una ilusión
En tu pensamiento
Que te hace hacer cosas
Así funciona el corazón

Bien vestido y en mi Lexus pasé por tu colegio
Me informan que te fuiste, como un loco te fui a alcanzar
Te busqué y no te encontraba, y eso me preocupaba
Para calmar mi ansia yo te quería llamar
Pero no tenía tu número, y tu amiga ya me lo negó
Ser bonito mucho me ayudó, y eso me trajo la solución
Yo sé que le gustaba, y le di una mirada
Con par de palabritas, tu número me dio
Del celular llamaba y tú no contestabas
Luego te puse un beeper y no había conexión
Mi única esperanza es que oigas mis palabras
No puedo, tengo novio
No me enganches, por favor

No, no es amor (Escúchame por favor)
Lo que tú sientes (¿Qué es?) se llama obsesión
Una ilusión (Estoy perdiendo el control)
En tu pensamiento
Que te hace hacer cosas
Así funciona el corazón
(Mi amor, por Dios no me enganches, espérate, que hay más)

Hice cita pa'l psiquiatra, a ver si me ayudaba
Pues ya no tengo amigos por sólo hablar de ti
Lo que quiero es hablarte, para intentar besarte
¿Será posible que de una obsesión me pueda morir?
Y quizás pienses que soy tonto, pribón y también loco
Pero es que en el amor soy muy original
Me enamoro como otros, conquisto a mi modo
Amar es mi talento, te voy a enamorar
Disculpa si te ofendo, pero es que soy honesto
Con lujo de detalles, escucha mi versión
Pura crema y chocolate, untarte y devorarte
Llevarte a otro mundo en tu mente, corazón
Ven vive una aventura, hagamos mil locuras
Voy a hacerte caricias que no se han inventa'o

(Let me find out)
No es amor, no es amor, es una obsesión (Oh no)
No es amor, no es amor (No, no), es una obsesión (No, woah)
No es amor, no es amor, es una obsesión (No, woah)
No es amor, no es amor (Uuh), es una obsesión (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)
No es amor, no es amor, es una obsesión

Crashed a car with you
Should have split in two
But that evil tree
Couldn't take it from me

I never care, what people say
I live my life, no other way
Yeah, we could die, a million ways
But we’re alive, another day

Crashed a plane with you
We fell into the blue
But that evil wind
Couldn't kill us again

I never care, what people say

But we're alive, another day

Ooh, ooh, ooh

You put the boom boom into my heart
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain (Yeah, yeah)
Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same

But something's buggin' me
Something ain't right
My best friend told me what you did last night
Left me sleepin' in my bed
I was dreamin' but I should've been with you instead

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high
Yeah, yeah

You take the grey skies out of my way
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
Turned a bright spark into a flame (Yeah, yeah)
My beats per minute never been the same
'Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Come on, baby, let's not fight
We'll go dancing, everything will be all right

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo

Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

Yeah
You and your friends, you live on the surface
Act like you're perfect, everyone knows
You're just like everyone else
Except for you're better at taking photos
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Why you gotta make everything a show?

Man, you're so fucking fake, ah
You don't mean a single thing you say, ah
If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah
And you're just like all the people that you hate
You're so fake
When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone

Calling me up when you're getting drunk
You say you're in love, but what do you mean?
'Cause when you wake up, you blame it on drugs
And then we break up, you lie through your teeth
You just wanna play little games for attention
(You just wanna play little games for attention)
Telling me your perfect lies and wasting all my time

'Cause you're so fucking fake, ah
You don't mean a single thing you say, ah
If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah
And you're just like all the people that you hate
You're so fake
When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone

You just wanna play little games for attention
(You just wanna play little games for attention)
Pushing me away so I crave your affection
(Pushing me away so I crave your affection)
Calling me insane, but you stay in my mentions
(Calling me insane, but you stay in my mentions)
Telling me your perfect lies and wasting all my time

'Cause you're so fucking fake, ah
You don't mean a single thing you say, ah (Oh)
If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah (Oh)
And you're just like all the people that you hate
You're so fake (Woo)

Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?

Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Do, re, mi, fa, so
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, if I could go back to that day we met
I probably would just stay in bed
You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound
Of breaking glass on my Range Rover
Pay me back or bitch, it's over
All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder
Next time I'ma stay asleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, oh

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch, you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya
It go like

Do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl
So fuckin' done with all the games you play
I ain't no Tic-tac-toe
Send the X and O's on another note
I'm do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
(Ghost, ghost, ghost)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)

If I could go back to the day we met
I probably would've stayed in bed
You wake up every day
And make me feel like I'm incompetent
Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliments your make-up bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
'Cause everybody want to tap that ass sometime

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch, you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya
It go like

Bebe, I got ya

Friends come and go, friends come and go
Go, like the seasons
I never know, I never know what to believe in
And it's getting old, it's getting old
But no hard feelings
'Cause friends come and go, friends come and go without a reason
And I, I've been in L.A. for way too long
Can't get this air inside my lungs
It feels like I'm suffocatin' from all the lack of the realness here

Is there anybody real out here?
Got my middle, middle up while I'm singing

Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends

And lately I've been dealin' with mad stress
Comes with the territory of a Hollywood address
Is anybody real here?
I need some fact checks
I need more realness, need you to act less
'Cause they deserve Oscars, so many imposters
What's up with guest lists?
Can I come to your concerts?
We all got demons, I'm dealin' with monsters
I've taken every picture, signed titties and signed shirts
But at the same time I know I'm blessed to be here
So let's just be clear
A million kids wish they had the spot I got
Success is not a sandy beach chair
Be careful with the people you meet here, I'm sayin'
Uh, yeah

Is there anybody real out here? (G)
Got my middle, middle up while I'm singing (Uh)

Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends

Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
(Yeah) We don't need 'em
(Bebe, you know I feel you)

And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
Say it to my face, don't pretend
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
Say it to my face, don't pretend

I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy

I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

I watch the city burn
These dreams like ashes float away
Your voice I never heard
Only silence
Where were you when our hearts were bleeding
Where were you when it all crashed down
Never thought that you'd deceive me
Where are you now

How long can you stand the pain
How long will you hide your face
How long will you be afraid
Are you afraid
How long will you play this game
Will you fight or will you walk away
How long will you let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

I watch the city burn
These passions slowly smoldering
A lesson never learned
Only violence
Is your world just a broken promise
Is your love just a drop of rain
Will we all just burn our fire
Are you still there

How long can you stand the pain
How long will you hide your face
How long will you be afraid
Are you afraid
How long will you play this game
Will you fight or will you walk away
How long will you let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

Will you wait until it all burns down
Will you hide until it all burns down
Will it hurt when it all burns down
Will you fight when it all burns down
Will you stand when it all burns down
Will you love when it all burns down
Will it end when it all burns down
Will you just let it all burns down

How long can you stand the pain
How long will you hide your face
How long will you be afraid
Are you afraid
How long will you play this game
Will you fight or will you walk away
How long will you let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

To find this love of mine
I’d walk through wind and fire
Forever and always
These hollow hands reach out
For you to touch me now
Forever and always
Dead inside
My heart and soul flatlines
Put your mouth on mine
And bring me back to life
Dead inside
No other satisfies
My blood runs dry
Take my life
Save me from this death inside
I can’t escape this love
I want it the way it was
Forever and always
Don’t you leave me here
Alone in all this fear
Forever and always

Dead inside
My heart and soul flatlines
Put your mouth on mine
And bring me back to life
Dead inside
No other satisfies
My blood runs dry
Take my life
Save me from this death inside

I can’t escape this love
I want it the way it was
You remind me of a time
When I felt alive
Dead inside
My heart and soul flatlines
Put your mouth on mine
And bring me back to life
Dead inside
No other satisfies
My blood runs dry
Take my life
Save me from this death inside
My blood runs dry
Take my life
Save me from this death inside

I went to bed I was thinking about you
Ain't the same since I'm living without you
All the memories are getting colder
All the things that I want to do over
Went to bed I was thinking about you
I want to talk and laugh like we used to
When I see you in my dreams at night
It's so real but it's in my mind

And now
I guess
This is as good as it gets

Don't wake me
Because I don't wanna leave this dream
Don't wake me
Because I never seem to stay asleep enough
When it's you I'm dreaming of
I don't want to wake up

I went to bed I was thinking about you
And how it felt when I finally found you
It's like a movie playing over in my head
Don't want to look because i know how it ends
All the words that I said that I wouldn't say
All the promises I made that I wouldn't break
It's last call, last song, last dance
Because I can't get you back, can't get a second chance


Don't wake me
Because I don't want to leave this dream
Don't wake me
Because I never seem to stay asleep enough
When it's you I'm dreaming of
I don't want to wake up
Don't wake me
We're together just you and me
Don't wake me
Because we're happy like we used to be
I know I've got to let you go
But I don't want to be alone

These dreams of you keep on growing stronger
It ain't a lot but it's all I have
Nothing to do but keep sleeping longer
Don't want to stop cause I want you back


I went to bed I was thinking about you
Because I don’t want to leave this dream
It ain’t the same since I’m living without you
Because I never seem to stay asleep enough
I know I’ve got to let you go
But I don’t want to wake up
 
<<Negative>>
 
I hate feeling like this
I'm so tired of trying to fight this
I'm asleep and all I dream of
Is waking to you
Tell me that you will listen
Your touch is what I'm missing
And the more I hide I realize I'm slowly losing you

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't want to live
I don't want to breathe
'Less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)

I hate living without you
Dead wrong to ever doubt you
But my demons lay in waiting
Tempting me away
Oh, how I adore you
Oh, how I thirst for you
Oh, how I need you

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't want to live
I don't want to breathe
'Less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)

Breathing life
Waking up
My eyes open up

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't want to live
I don't want to breathe
'Less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to dream

Oh, how I thirst for you

Oh, how I adore you, ohhhh
The way you make me feel
Waking up to you never felt so real

Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me, and take my hand

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You got to take it in

Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh, a good, good life
Yeah
Oh, oh

Hopelessly, I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly, I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly, I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly, the hope is we have
So much to feel good about

Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

Oh, yeah
Good, good life
Good life
Ooh, ooh
Oh

One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know

People say I got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem
I call it a solution

Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because

Heartless, heartless, heartless
So heartless, so heartless, so heartless

Say you're goin' out late
I count down 'til you call me
It's just one of those things
That you do when you're lonely
And you're all about the chase
But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same
But I know I'm gonna let you
Win again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like hell
And you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself

But why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless? (So heartless, so heartless)

Monday night was definitely not our night
Tuesday night was just another fight
Wednesday, I thought everything would change
Thursday came and it was still the same
Friday night, we went out on the town
Saturday, we should have burned it down
Sunday morning came and now you're gone
I should probably know this shit by now
Ah, oh (Ah, oh)
I should probably know this shit by now
But no (But no), no

Why you gotta be so heartless?

Loving me and leaving, leaving?

Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more rows and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm takin' you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight

Got a little dirt on my boots

A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

You hit me like a hurricane

Hammerin' a nail, stackin' them bales
I'm dog tired by the 5 o'clock hour
But I'm ready to raise some hell
And Jesse's gettin' ready, I'm gassin' up the Chevy
I'm gonna pick her up at six
I hope she's gonna wear the jeans with the tear
That her mama never fixed

The moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here

Mud on the grips, wild cherry on her lips
I've been workin' and tryin' and flirtin' and dyin'
For an all night kinda kiss
And country on the boombox, candles on the tool box
I'm doin' everything right, got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight

Yeah, the moon comes up and the sun goes down

Alright, alright
Yeah, it's alright, alright

Don't need no five star reservations
I got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
Don't need no concert in the city
I got a stereo and the 'Best Of Patsy Cline'

Ain't got no caviar, no Dom Perignon
But as far as I can see I got everything I want

Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

Maybe later on we'll walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you

May be a simple life but that's okay, yeah
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made

Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

When I lay down at night I thank the lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of

Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me

Well I got a call from Rowdy ‘round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hankerin’ for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, "Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?"
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

C'mon
Now I've never been the kind to quit
Won't stop 'til I get to the bottom of this
And the night's still young so whatcha say we shotgun one?
Hell we'll shoot one with you Luke, come on Ronnie

There's no stoppin' me once I get to goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
About half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man, I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hit me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
Yeah, 5-4-3-2-1 too many

When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feeling
Comes to my door
And the whole world turns
Blue
There's a rundown bar
'Cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two
Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losin' you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
I close my eyes
And sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
She'll come back someday

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

Oh if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on
Drink by drink
And the words of every sad song
Seem to say what I think
And this hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

Come watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Oh, watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn’t think that it was true

That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin’
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do

Thunder in my soul, baby
My heart beats for you only

When they kick out your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting in death row
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, Guns of Brixton
The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell
You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of The Harder They Come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh-the guns of Brixton
When they kick out your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
You can crush us
You can bruise us
And even shoot us
But oh, the guns of Brixton
Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game was survivin'
As in heaven as in hell
You can crush us
You can bruise us

Oh, the guns of Brixton

Just read the writings on the wall it's a message we send
And Babylon will never live to stop the rising of Jah son

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

It's not everyday we're gonna be the same way
There must be a change somehow
There are bad times and good times too
So have a little faith in what you do
Cause you don't seem to realize
The things you've got to face in life
Today you're up, tomorrow you're down
So thank God that you're still around town
Though we've got to work like slaves
Just to eat a piece of bread
But as we go along each day we'll find
Happiness to sooth the mind cause
It's not everyday we're gonna be the same way
There must be a change somehow
There are bad times and good times too
So have a little faith in what you do

Now, greetings to the world!
Voice to the one called Skip Marley!
Alongside the lion in the jungle
Big Gongzilla, the youngest uncle

I know you drunk in power: brother, that's not juice
I see you chasing Mil’s: my brother, that's not food
When the banana peels, I tell you that's not fruit
Another brother shot down, but that’s not news

Don't you fall from grace
Brother, don't throw it all away
A wise man used to say
"Money ain't life, so take it easy"

Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true

You’re lying with the liars: baby, that’s not you
The way you're never smiling, baby, that’s not cute
I see he got you crying: baby, that's not smooth
The chaos and the violence, baby, that's not cool

Don't you fall from grace (No way)
My love don’t give your heart away (No way)
A wise man used to say
"If she's amazing, she won't be easy"

Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true

Better you build a bridge, than instead of you build a wall
Better to love and lost, than to never have loved at all
Better to do today, than instead of you putting it off
Tomorrow nuh sure and that is for sure, so better you give it you all
Better you stand up and better you get up and rise, whenever you fall
Better you smile instead of you cry, and even better you laugh
Embarrassment better than gas pain, me friend, so better you fart
Anything better than hungry, wisdom better than smart
Better dem doe boda gwan like dem tuff, 'cause I bet when you check it dem soft
Gwaan like dem bad and a buck like a bull but I bet when you check is a calf
Real is better than fraud, freedom better than bought
Gold is better than bronze, bronze is better than brass, but
Health is better than wealth, and peace is better than war
Now is better than later, the present is better than past
Prevention better than cure, and long life better than fast
Question better than answer
Better you answer, just tell me yours

Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true

You say you're hurting oh cause
They say I'm flirting oh no
You just can't take it anymore
Your friends say I'm no good for you
But in my heart I'm so true
A partner for life we can be sure
You've asked me for some time to clear you're mind
I stayed away, it hurts so much
Without your touch
Now I'm back and you say
Chorus:
Just a little bit longer baby
Cause my love keeps growing stronger
A little more time to say
But in my head a love song plays
For you and me
We played in the rain together
That feeling lives on forever
Memories that bring tears of joy
We've had our share of bad times too
Hurthing each other me and you
It's brought us much closer in the end
Just too much we've both fought for
To put it all down the drain
I've stayed away just for a while
But now you're driving me insane
Chorus
I said all there is to say now
Hoping that you'll make me stay
Believe me I'm yearning for you girl
Hope there's a place in your heart
That remembers the good from the start
Just put me back where I belong
You asked me for some time to clear your mind
I stayed away, it hurts so much
Without your touch now I'm back and you say

Please don't stop loving me

Hmmmmm I've got a crush on someone- guess who?
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night time hear me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush my baby on you
How glad a million laddies from millionaires to caddies
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time hear me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you


Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for

I love you

The scene is set for dreaming
Love's knocking at the door
But oh my heart, I'm reluctant to start
For we've been fooled before
The night is like a lovely tune
Beware, my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart
There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the magic of a kiss
Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start
For this time, it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love, my foolish heart
For this time, it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love, my foolish heart
 
<<Positive>>
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song, oh, yeah, yeah
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known, o, yeah, yeah
You smiled, you smiled, o, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day and through
In that small cafe
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut trees, the wishing well
I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise

La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la, la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She said, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh I know the sun must set to rise"

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

How lucky can one guy be
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said
Ain't that a kick in the head?

The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote
"Ain't that a hole in the boat"

My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful

I've sunshine enough to spread
It's just like the fella said
Tell me quick ain't love like a kick in the head?

My life is gonna be beautiful

She's telling me we'll be wed
She's picked out a king size bed
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick
Tell me quick, oh, ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

So it's Christmas once more

I don't want a lot for Christmas

With a toy on Christmas Day

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas

I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)

Standing right outside my door

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

"Merry Christmas" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun

Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray) I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Breakaway
Breakaway

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say "sit down; it's just a talk"
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And I pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

I am unwritten, can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten, yeah
Oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries, are outside the lines, yeah
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, no, oh

Just a small-town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere


A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night


Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feeling
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feeling
Streetlight people

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

True stories
She wrote to me telling me it's help she needs
She said that she cries every night and she's weak
I told her you just gotta try to breath
She said I can't cope anymore
And now I just bleed (x3)
Why does everyone look so damn perfect
I'm fifteen and I feel really worthless
My skin doesn't look so clean
When I've got these freckles covering me
I wanna look like Katy Perry
Maybe Rihanna or Halle Berry
Beyonce never had problems like me
Bet she never felt so fat and ugly
I wanna be skinny but I get so hungry
Got bad pains inside of my tummy
There's a guy in school that I hope might notice me
But he never really does
So I'm trynna get thin so he looks my way
And he falls in love
Until then I'll just sit on the bed
Scratching these scissors across my legs
She wrote to me telling me it's help she needs
She said that she cries every night and she's weak
I told her you just gotta try to breath
She said I can't cope anymore
And now I just bleed (x3)
Why does everyone look so damn perfect
I'm seventeen and I feel really nervous
There's a guy that I like and he might just like me back
I hope that he'll ask me out
I hope that he won't even notice the scars that are drying out
My legs are a mess and my arms look even worse
I won't wear a dress or short skirts
I had a bad time these past few years
Lost some friends and I shed some tears
I can't cope when things get messed up
I try to move on but I always get stuck
Yet again I fall into the same mistakes
But it feels so safe and I find release
I guess you would never understand
The feeling that comes with with a knife in your hand
She wrote to me telling me it's help she needs
She said that she cries every night and she's weak
I told her you just gotta try to breath
She said I can't cope anymore
And now I just bleed (x4)
Why does everyone look so damn perfect
It's Photoshop, airbrush merges
I'm twenty-four now I feel like I'm growing
I still hurt but the pains not showing
I haven't cut for a month or two
I try deep breathing and squeezing ice cubes
My boyfriend loves me and tells me I'm beautiful
I'm ashamed of what I used to do
I try everyday just to keep getting better
To block out the thoughts but I'm under the weather
The pressure is building, I need a release
I'm out of my depth and I'm feeling weak
I'm sick of this pain and I want it to end
My oldest enemy and my only friend
A blade in my hand and my life in front of me
I'm stranded between relapse and recovery

Lie to me
Convince me that I've been sick forever
And all of this will make sense when I get better
(Bleed, I bleed and I breathe)

She wrote to me telling me it's help she needs
She said that she cries every night and she's weak

Memories consume, like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls 'cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again and this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I’m breaking the habit tonight

Yo, listen up, here's the story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue
Like him inside and outside
Blue his house with a blue little window and a blue Corvette
And everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around

Blue is the color of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my Corvette, it's standing outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted (woah oh, woah oh, oh)
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life and it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive

If I wasn't here tomorrow
Would anybody care?
If my time was up I'd wanna know
You were happy I was there
If I wasn't here tomorrow
Would anyone lose sleep?
If I wasn't hard and hollow
Then maybe you would miss me

I know I'm a mess and I wanna be someone
Someone that I like better
I can never forget
So don't remind me of it forever
(Forever)

What if I just pulled myself together?
Would it matter at all?
What if I just tried not to remember?
Would it matter at all?
All the chances that have passed me by
Would it matter if I gave it one more try?
Would it matter at all?

If I wasn't here tomorrow
Would anybody care?
Still stuck inside this sorrow
I've got nothin' and goin' nowhere

Ladder's about to fall
Thirteen month old baby

In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye
But I've never wondered why

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly
So I've never had to lie

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie

You're just some racist who can't tie my laces

You want to be like your father, it's approval you're after
Well, that's not how you find it
Do you, do you really enjoy living a life that's so hateful?
'Cause there's a hole where your soul should be
You're losing control of it
And it's really distasteful

Raise your glass

Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Oh momma dear, we're not the fortunate ones

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

Some fun

Wind me up, put me down, start me off and watch me go
I'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know
A little off center, and I'm out of tune
Just kickin' this can along the avenue, but I'm all right

Because it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out (When you jerk it out)

Shut up, hush your mouth, can't you hear, you talk too loud?
No, I can't hear nothing because I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I can chew
I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue, but that's okay

Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out

Staring at my food but I can not eat it
Laying in my bed but I am not sleeping
Crying in my room and I keep it top secret
Because people tell me they care but they do not mean it
I'm cut open, even though I am not bleeding
My heart's broken, so I'mma make it stop beating
Someone runs in the room and screams
"He's not breathing!"
I'm rushed to the hospital to have a Doc treat it
But he cannot beat it, there's no time at all
Cause I just popped some pills with some Tylenol
And 3 bottles of antidepressants, and Sambuca
40 ounces, got killed I didn't puke up anything
There's no use in pumping my stomach
Cause I'll just do it again
I'm a lost cause, so fuck it
Everyone with grudges towards me is gonna love this
The smiles on their faces when my death goes public

Cause I'm killing myself
Taking matters to my own hands
I can't picture myself as a grown man
I don't wanna grow up
I hate change and everything's just so rearranged
My life's nothing but a disaster
And time keeps going by faster
But in a second all that shit won't matter
Fuck this I'mma kill myself

I act happy
But I wanna die, I'm not gonna lie
Thoughts of suicide keep crossing my mind on a regular basis
Going crazy, cause I'm going through bullshit on a regular basis
Look me in the face, I'm sick in my eyes
Cause I'm sick in the mind
I've been wishing to die ever since I was 9
This isn't a lie
I don't bitch just to whine
Or bullshit just to rhyme about it
I don't cry just to spit
Just to try to guilt trip
Cause I could give two shits about your pity
I ain't trying to get everyone to feel bad for me
I'd rather dis everyone and make y'all mad at me
I ain't a happy person and I ain't that liked
Not even by myself
I know I ain't that nice
But people don't understand how much I hate my life
Cause if they did they'd know how bad
I want to take this knife and be

Killing myself
Taking matters to my own hands
I can't picture myself as a grown man
I don't wanna grow up
I hate change and everything's just so rearranged
My life's nothing but a disaster
And time keeps going by faster
But in a second all that shit won't matter
Fuck this I'mma kill myself

I quit, I'm bailing, I'm done
I finally give up
I'm sick of failing, I'm done trying to live up
To the expectations everyone has set for me
And trying to explain shit to myself
Always questioning about my destination
Fuck my destiny
No more relationships
My friends are all dead to me
My head is aching, and I don't have any energy
I'm patiently waiting for the day that I can rest in peace
And this medication is the reason that I don't get no sleep
It ain't worth taking
So I just take some ecstasy
Then hear my friends
"You're an E-tard fuck up."
Maybe killing myself will
Make you retards shut up!
Cause I only do it once in a while
At times when I forget how to fucking smile
I hate being belittled when y'all act like you're
Looking out for me
If you were looking out of me then
I wouldn't about to be

Killing myself
Taking matters to my own hands
I can't picture myself as a grown man
I don't wanna grow up
I hate change and everything's just so rearranged
My life is nothing but a disaster
And time keeps going by faster
But in a second all that shit won't matter
Fuck this I'mma kill myself

When the time comes
I'll be crying then
I'll have to get a hold of myself
Call all my friends, and say goodbye to them
Then get high and then call up all my friends again
And say goodbye again
And cry again
Stop crying- smile
Find a pen, write down some last words
Somebody will find them when
I'm in Heaven looking down on them
Or who knows?
The way shit's been going- maybe Hell, looking up on them
But either way I'm watching
I'm waiting their reaction
Suddenly someone walks in
Wait they ain't laughing
They read it and start crying
They actually do care
I'm shocked, I can't believe they're sad that I ain't there
They miss me
Man what a horrible mistake I made
And I can't take it back, it's way to late
If only I could relive my life
I'd re-make this song
Rewrite the hook and it would be like..

Life's shit
But I'm taking matters to my own hands
I can picture myself as a grown man
I wanna grow up, I can deal with change
Even if everything gets rearranged
Maybe my life's a disaster
And time keeps going by faster
But now I can see all that shit don't matter
Fuck that I'mma live my life!

You come to me with scars on your wrist
You tell me this will be the last night feeling like this
I just came to say goodbye
I didn't want you to see me cry, I'm fine
But I know it's a lie

This is the last night you'll spend alone
Look me in the eyes so I know you know
I'm everywhere you want me to be
The last night you'll spend alone
I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go
I'm everything you need me to be

Your parents say everything is your fault
But they don't know you like I know you they don't know you at all
I'm so sick of when they say
It's just a phase, you'll be o.k. you're fine
But I know it's a lie

This is the last night you'll spend alone
Look me in the eyes so I know you know
I'm everywhere you want me to be
The last night you'll spend alone
I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go
I'm everything you need me to be
The last night away from me


The night is so long when everything's wrong
If you give me your hand I will help you hold on
Tonight
Tonight

This is the last night you'll spend alone
Look me in the eyes so I know you know
I'm everywhere you want me to be
The last night you'll spend alone
I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go
I'm everything you need me to be

I won't let you say goodbye
I'll be your reason why

The last night away from me
Away from me

We play games with a sick rhyme like it's crime
Clock's set in the clockwise, countering our lives
We speak love like who knows the where what's why
And I find the fine signs as high times
Skyflier spinnin' in spites phalange sit and flex
Like Jay doesn't know that Drake is the 
It's sin sits sinning in  is well spent
Legs broke my days so I choke onto what's next
And I ain't got shit, shit I ain't had shit in years
But I've been shoveling shit like my shit is set in fears
And I bottle the pump shotty with Cobain cocaine
Like the nemesis with a sidekick pumps to backs veins with
Man genetics to grow emotionally apathetic
Been running so long the calisthenics are copasetic
I cap heads like stack  anesthetics
Old souls of black folks to antiseptics like that

You don't know how to act
Act like nothing happened
Act like nothing happened
Act like nothing happened

Evangelistic
I speak with the chords of angel business
My misery is paranormal, reason's no Hayley Williams
Neon mission, the prism differs so Shinji Lilith
And Asuka is the angry mistress to crazy women
In hopes that my Langley makes Sohryu enough to maybe miss the division
Electrical currents I mainly envision
Since my mind wards low tides like the zaniest Christians
A life after the death of stretch banged with banging pistons
You can chew on my lyrics and end up believing their screeching of malnourishment
I regurgitate my words and fire acidic pertinence
Penance, I renounce my soul to breathe life into this sentence
And get God of galactic a castrophe of sad endings
And it gets sad as life flashes, the baddest mandem
I battle toads on rocky roads till dads are fencing
And it bleeds on it's sun, son is a phantom menace
My life kicks and the light flicks so it sits on this perfect ending

Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Ah, me, ah, me, ah

Yeah

Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (Yeah)

I gave her everything
She took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken heart's contagious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture bein' in love
I love when you're around
But I fuckin' hate when you leave

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my hand
Still, I'll never understand why you hang around
I see what's going down
Cover up with makeup in the mirror
Tell yourself, "It's never gonna happen again"
You cry alone, and then
He swears he loves you

Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now, as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world'll bear a consequence
If you wade around forever, you will surely drown
I see what's going down

I see the way you go and say you're right again
Say you're right again, heed my lecture

Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

Face down in the dirt, she said, "This doesn't hurt"
She said, "I finally had enough"
Face down in the dirt, she said, "This doesn't hurt"
She said, "I finally had enough"

One day she will tell you that she has had enough
It’s coming 'round again

Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end

I'm lying here on the floor where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm crying here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can

Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills
They were different
Maybe I should get some help

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine

Shadows are falling all over town
Another night and these blues got me down
Oh, misery! I sure could use some company
Oh sing it girl!
Since he's been gone I ain't been the same
I carry the weight like an old ball and chain
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause such misery

Oh misery! Oh misery!
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause me misery

And, oh! I've been down this road before
With a passion that turns into pain
And each time I saw love walk out the door
I swore I'd never get caught again
But ain't it true? It takes what it takes
And sometime we get too smart to leave
One more heartache for me
Another night of misery

Oh! And oh misery! Oh misery!
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me
Oh misery! Oh misery!
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why does this
Heart make a fool of me
Seems its my destiny
For love to cause misery, oh
Misery
Guess its all meant to be
For love to cause me misery, oh, no, yeah
Misery

No sleep, no sex for you from your ex-girlfriend
I was too deep, I can't let you go and just jump in
At times I would push my feelings aside to let you feel
I'm novocain
I'm numb and nothing's real

Like the coldest winter, I am frozen from you

I was weak before now you made me so numb
I can't feel much for you anymore
I gave you my all, my baby
I'm numb, numb, numb

But the tears were silent inside you see
But the tears were silent inside you see

I laid there quiet, watched you have your way with me
I might have cried, the tears were silent inside, you see
You called me names, made me feel like I was dumb
I didn't feel a thing and now I'm gone, gone, gone

Like a battered child I got used to your pain
But you know its because

I was weak before now you made me so numb
I can't feel much for you anymore
I gave you my all, my baby
I'm numb, numb, numb
I was weak before now you made me so numb
I can't feel much for you anymore
I gave you my all, my baby
I'm numb, numb, numb

Don't feel a thing, don't feel the pain
Numb, numb, numb
Said

I was weak before now you made me so numb
I can't feel much for you anymore
I gave you my all, my baby
I'm numb, numb, numb

I was weak for
Said now I'm numb, numb, numb
No, no, no, no
 
<<Negative>>
 
I can remember the very first time I cried
How I wiped my eyes and buried the pain inside
All of my memories - good and bad - that's past
Didn't even take the time to realize

Starin' at the cracks in the walls
'Cause I'm waiting for it all to come to an end
Still I curl up right under the bed
'Cause it's takin' over my head all over again

Do you even know who you are?
I guess I'm tryin' to find a borrowed dream or a superstar
I want to be a star
Is life good to you or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?

Lyin' awake watchin' the sunlight
How the birds will sing as I count the rings around my eyes
Constantly pushing the world I know aside
I don't even feel the pain, I don't even want to try

I'm lookin' for a way to become
The person that I dreamt of when I was sixteen
Oh, nothin' is ever enough
Ooh, baby, it ain't enough for what it may seem

Do you even know who you are?
I'm still tryin' to find a borrowed dream or a superstar
Everybody wants to be
Is life good to you or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
No

Sorry girl, tell a tale for me
'Cause I'm wondering how you really feel
I'm a lonely girl, I'll tell a tale for you
'Cause I'm just tryin' to make all my dreams come true

Do you even know who you are?
Oh, yeah, yeah
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
Oh, I wanted to be a star
Is life good to you or is it bad?
I can't tell, I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
I guess not, I guess not
Do you even know who you are?
Oh, I'm tryin' to find
A rising dream or a fallen star?
Oh, I have all these dreams
Is life good to you or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
No, no

Do you even know who you are?
A rising dream or a fallen star?
Is life good to you or is it bad?

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?


When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, "Something's out there"
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by


99 red balloons
Floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine, it springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
As 99 red balloons go by

99 Decision Street
99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call out the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it, boys, this is war
The president is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by

99 knights of the air
Ride super high-tech jet fighters
Everyone's a super hero
Everyone's a Captain Kirk
With orders to identify
To clarify and classify
Scramble in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by
99 red balloons go by

99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In this dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here...
And here is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go

Waking in sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place, there's no escape
I'm my own worst enemy...

I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared, I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares
I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

God!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my
Put me out of my fucking misery!

I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

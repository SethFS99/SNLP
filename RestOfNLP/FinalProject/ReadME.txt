This Project is a program that will analyze the lyrics of a song to determine if they are happy or sad songs.
This was done using linear regression and utilizing the literal weight of each word in a song in relation to their semantic value in Glove.50
Requires sklearn to run as well as access to lyricGenius API. 
List of identified music used to train was gathered by myself and my partner for the project and self identified used YouTube and spotify playlists under the name happy/sad songs and personal choices for ones that were vague on purpose.
